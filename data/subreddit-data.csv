personalfinance,Taxes during retirement ,"I have been searching for this information, but have not been able to find an exact answer. My mom will be retiring next year. She will have Social Security benefits, a pension and a 401(k) account. It looks like the first 10 K of Social Security benefit is not taxed. In the hypothetical situation of getting 22k in SS and 15k pension, how much would she pay in taxes for her 401(k) withdrawals? Is it better to withdraw some amount annually or keep all of the 401(k) funds in the account? Based on our calculations my mom should be able to live comfortably off of her pension and Social Security benefits(she’s very frugal with very low bills). anything I am missing when thinking about this?

personalfinance,16k car silly choice?,"Hello, as title says I’ve been looking around at cars at 16k mark and recently this week my car was actually stolen so has now kind of given me a push! Would it be a silly move to take if taken into account; I get £175 a day Monday to Friday 0 if I’m not in/ill with full time permanent job, I’ve got around 52k saved up and save around £500 a week, living with my mum as I can’t find a reasonable house to buy/mortgage.
So would dishing out 16k on a car be a silly impulse and should I be smart and just get an average 5/6k car?

personalfinance,Financial Advice on Savings,"Hi Folks,

So I'm torn about what I should do with my savings. I am the following:

1. 35 years old  
2. 70k salary  
2. Live and work in NYC  
3. Have 100k in student debt that I'm waiting to have forgiven  
4. Have 200k in a HYSA  
5. Have 50k in a retirement account  
5. Zero non-student debt

I have been saving hard for 10 years and that's how I saved up my 200k. My intention was to use this money to buy myself some property but I feel like I keep getting further away from homeownership with each passing year. Is there anything I can do to help strengthen my hand so I can buy property in the next few years or should I forgo homeownership in the near future and move my money into the stock market? Perhaps, I should be doing something else?",1728231083.0,1,2,1fxk29l

As If I switch and then going for a iphone it will be around 70k at that time(and please I have made up my mind about Iphone). Also there's a dilemma about going for it is after iphone13 there's almost nil new features so that is also deferring my decision.

personalfinance,"Realistically, can I afford to buy a condo? ","Hi 

Mid 20s

I make 55k in the midwest and have saved about 40k. Including my current 750 rent, utilities and car/phone expenses and wants/needs, I only spend $2,000 a month. My pay is about to go up to 66k, and I will be at 70k in 6 months. 

I am paying off my car in a month. After my car loan, my only debt is student debt (28k, all federal loans, i will be eligible for pslf in 9 years so i pay the minimum of 150). 

In my area i can get a small condo around 180,00-200,000 with decent upgrades in the 200,000-250,000 range. Thinking about 10% down with 20k and paying the PMI so I still have 20k of emergency savings. 

My lease ends in 6 months. Should I stick with roommates and the cheap rent for another year? Would pulling the trigger now be reckless? Or should I start building equity as soon as I can? 


Edit: to clarify I will not pay off my student loans. My HSA has a higher interest than my loans (4.8 vs 4.2). And again, I qualify for PSLF (where loans are forgiven after ten years). I will be paying less over the course of 10 years with the forgiveness of the remainder, than if I pay them all off tomorrow. ",1728228639.0,0,6,1fxj4bj
personalfinance,"HELOC, Co-signer on Mortgage, and Consumer proposal","How would taking out a HELOC on my mortgage affect the person I have co-signed onto my mortgage?

So my Grandma is a cosigner on my mortgage but does not live with me, she just helped me qualify for my home.  I was looking info a consumer proposal but the LIT i spoke with encouraged me to look into a HELOC first.  My question is how would a HELOC affect my co-signer? would she need to consent to it as well even tho I am the only one paying for my mortgage?

What are the pros and cons of a HELOC and in reality would this be better than a consumer proposal?

I have about 80,000 in home equity and 66,000 worth of unsecured debt.  If I went the CP route I would pay $1430 per month for 5 years paying them an extra 19,000 in fees and what no over that 5 years.  With a HELOC the current rate is 6.95% so in the long run would I be paying more than 19,000 in interest?  I was told to put that into mind as well, if i would end up paying way more in interest then the CP would be the best route.   But I also need to know how this would affect my cosigner as it is important to me that it does not affect her at all and also that she doesn't know the type of debt I'm in as for me that personal and would cause tension in my family.

  
And again like I asked in a pervious post my mortgage is up for renewal in August of 2025, If I were to stay with my current lender which is Tangerine and just renew is there still a risk of being declined because I'd be in a consumer proposal? Do they do a credit check on people who are just renewing with them?",1728228246.0,0,0,1fxiyzi
personalfinance,Best no-risk investment options for 1-3 years ?,"I owe alimony for the next 3.5 years, and it's non-negotiable, meaning I owe that money even if I lose my job, health, etc.

Between an upcoming house sale and an end of year bonus at work, I'll be gaining roughly the entire amount of total alimony in liquidity in the next few months.

I'd like to set all of that money aside and let it work for me until it's due, but it needs to be risk free.

The first year I plan on putting in a HYSA and autopaying over the next year.

What about the rest of it?  Are there recommended (and safe) investments for those time periods (1, 2, and 3 years) that would make good use of this money while it's set aside?

Appreciate any insight!



Edit:

Sorry if I’m using the wrong term, I was thinking of anything getting interest as an investment.  But yeah, a savings account isn’t really an investment.

personalfinance,Bipolar SO bought an expensive car without telling me,"My partner has a long history of bipolar, particularly manic spells, which often lead him to making impulse purchases. (Yes, he is back on meds, but they take a while to kick in.) Well, the other day, he bought a $55,000 car without telling me because in his mania, he thought I would be excited that we now have a second car so we don't have to share. The monthly payments on this thing are $850, which we can't easily afford and would drastically impact our ability to get a house and have a baby, both of which we're hoping to do in the next year or so. He also took $5k, which was most of our savings, out for the down payment. We're so financially fucked right now, and I'm trying to figure out options so we are the least fucked possible. As I see it so far, here are our options, none of which are great:

1. Keep the car, budget, he gets a second job, we make the payments for a couple years, then sell it when we've paid off enough of the loan where it's worthwhile. This sucks because we're paying $10k a year. 

2. Sell it back to the dealer. This sucks because the value has depreciated, so we'll have to eat the difference out of pocket. I have no idea how much that difference is. But at least it would be more short-term and not a multiple-year ordeal. 

3. Voluntary repossession back to the dealer. Same deal financially as above(?), but worse for his credit. I don't know - any pros to this one that I'm missing?

4. Don't make payments, car gets repo'd. Also would be on the hook for fees and paying the difference in value, plus really bad for credit. On the plus side, get to drive the car for a few months?

5. File Chapter 7 bankruptcy. By far the cheapest option, but obviously that's an enormous hit to his credit and will make getting another car or a house a lot harder. 

Anything else I'm missing? I don't think there's any legal way to cancel this purchase out without eating a lot of money, but I'm planning on getting some legal advice just in case. I'm just so fucking disheartened right now. ",1728169905.0,1,4,1fx2wzy

personalfinance,Please help-no idea how to maximize savings and know absolutely nothing about investing. ,"Would love some advice on how to maximize my extra money. I know I can do more but I’m completely lost on what to do. I have maxed out my 401k, my employer does not offer Roth, and I Max out and use my HSA each year. I tried using vanguard to invest but I must’ve done something wrong. I added money to it to build it to like $11k and it gained like less than 5 bucks in a year ish. So now I use HYSAs but I realize now that I should be doing more. I just don’t know where to start or who to talk to about it. 

After taxes and automatic deductions, I make about $7800 per biweekly paycheck
With that, 1 pay about $6-8k in bills monthly. I just started making this in the past year so I’m still catching up on a lot of bills and loans I had deferred or were naturally in deferment during the time I had a significantly lower paying job. 
My monthly bills usually look like the following: ($2900 mortgage, $2000 in credit cards, $70 phone bill, $2200 in student loans. I also pay up to $1600 per month to help my family with their rent, but it varies per month. And yes, that’s nonnegotiable for me). I do not pay interest on the credit cards - this is the average cost to pay them off every month. Often times lower, occasionally higher. 

Note that all house hold expenses go on the credit card, which I in turn pay off each month. So those bills are comprised of groceries, gas, Costco runs, electric bill, home security bill, streaming services, eating out (which prob makes up about $300 or less for the both of us per month, including fast food and sit down restaurants) and every couple months when I get the dog groomed or have to buy his meds/pay vet bills for his annual checkup. It also includes my little Amazon habit lol but I don’t go too crazy - just mentioning that in full transparency I could certainly cut down there. 

I currently have $40k saved in an emergency fund, and $10k saved in a “bills HYSA” that I pay my bills out of and add a couple thousand to each paycheck. 

Loans:
- [ ] $77k in private loans at 3%
- [ ] $4000 in private loan at 5%
- [ ] $88k in federal loans at 3-7% (but currently paused )
- [ ] $25k credit card at 0% until May. I plan to put a part of my  bonus in January in a HYSA to pay this off in May. I have done this like 4-5 times now with 0 interest credit cards and have always paid off in full before incurring interest. I have racked this bill up over the year with some household expenses like a water treatment thing that cost $4k, our honeymoon which was $4k, wedding expenses (totaled 7k for a 50 person diy backyard wedding, which I’m very proud of lol-not all went on CC tho), $2-3k home improvement things including outdoor stuff like mulch and indoor stuff like an entertainment console (we just moved in last year), and taking my family (wife, mom, sister, niece and nephew) on a Disney cruise in April (ended up being $9k instead of $4k due to my mistake….

personalfinance,Career change w/o savings,"I’m considering a job offer. The job will increase my TAKE HOME pay by about 24%. The work is the same KIND of work I do now, but totally different industry and there will be a learning curve. There are other things about it that it make it drastically different than the job i’ve been at for 10 years.

I have no liquid savings and do have significant debt. Obviously increasing my income is a way to rectifying that.

But if something goes wrong and this job doesn’t work out, the job market is terrible. I’m concerned about what happens if I flop at this job for some reason.

Is it too risky to take it without savings in hand?

Edit to add more info:

- Once I have that extra money, I am extremely determined to use it all to pay off debt aggressively, and I have a plan for that. It’s just that I’m going to need a solid year before I get it down to a place where I don’t feel terrified about losing the job. 

- My current company is very stable and the job itself is VERY safe for various reasons.  This new company is small and growing fast, but newer. They are creating a role for me because they like me (!), but its contract and my contract would be renewed on an annual basis. (My 24% take home increase calculation already accounts for the changes in taxes, benefits etc.) In addition to all of the above, it would be an opportunity to plant the seeds to eventually pivot this into my own consulting business down the line if I decide to. I see that as a huge positive long term, but short term is obviously more risky.

I live with my parents and I know some of you are going to say take advantage of that as long as you can, and I relatively am but also getting a plan somewhat for moving out. Our house is TINY and I have no door. Boyfriend, who I’ve been with 5 years, lives with us. Works with me, makes 19.50 an hour.

Was contemplating the idea of putting electric and a septic tank a mile up the road from my house on our land and getting a tiny home or a mobile home. YES, I am aware it’s a depreciating asset BUT I’m not looking on this as an investment. It would give me the chance to still be near my parents, I’d have land for my dogs, and I wouldn’t have rent or a mortgage yet bc I don’t want to live in this state forever. Lowkey got reamed on this Reddit lol when I mentioned this before.

Also my boyfriend has 15k saved I believe. So we have a total of like 32k, BUT I count about 8k of mine as an emergency fund.

Yes, I know me and my boyfriend could break up upon this and some people freak out at the idea of me getting a place and living on family land with someone I’m not married to. Even if we did break up I’m 100% sure it would be amicably. Hell I’ll write up a contract if need be. And those worried my dad will pull some shady shit, he’s in good financial shape and isn’t like one of those people who will throw me under the bus and like steal a tiny home or trailer if we put it on his land. I’ll write a contract with him too if needed 😭. I’m an only child so there’s no weird sibling rivalry that could take over if he like died. Me and my boyfriend plan on getting married we’re just waiting bc we are young.

Currently pursing my finance degree, no student loans. Im cash flowing.
He’s planning on getting his nursing degree or something in health but waiting until we either move to the land or rent because it’s a bit cramped in our house and will give him some privacy.

Both of our cars are paid for and I have the money I need for a new one if worse came to worse. ANYWAYS onto the real question.

If don’t get a tiny home on the land and decide to rent, what bills upon moving out do I need to consider on a monthly basis? I am trying to get a sort of a plan. There will be two incomes bc my boyfriend will be coming with me lol. What are some things people tend to forget about?

(Also another reason for tiny home maybe mobile home is bc we have 4 animals and it’s so hard to find a place that will accept animals. And I want them to have ample room to run and I can build a fence on our land.) 

These are all future plans! Probably atleast 6 months in the future because I want to lay out a plan, figure out a budget that would be needed, and all that jazz.

Please be at least a little nice lol. I know it’s Reddit and the internet but I’m genuinely seeking al kinda of advice! I have people yell at me for stuff I didn’t even consider, I’m young and I have things to learn!! I’m open to constructive criticism. Thanks!

personalfinance,Questions about excessive dispute claims,"Well about 6 months ago I had some foreign merchant deducting small amounts of money out of my account that totaled to like $2,200. I got it all back and the merchant could not prove I had any dealings with them and I won the dispute. 

Last month I found more unfamiliar charges from the foreign merchants in Russia and Nigeria… totaling $325.00… I got my money back plus I won the claim!

EARLIER today  I was going over my statements plugging the numbers into my budgeting and financial planning app.. and I noticed some unfamiliar charges from stores and gas stations that I don’t remember going to… this is my business account and I literally have a log sheet when I’m doing deliveries and I write down how much I gas I put in my car, I document my meals, and miscellaneous. These 3 gas stations and stores were small amounts.. but it adds up. I filed the dispute tonight and they issued a credit of $30.00. 

However, after just going thru more statements.. I found more charges that I don’t recognize from gas stations and stores. The crazy part is I never lost my card… but I did get an alert from Experian that my information was found on a dark web site. I’m really thinking somebody is hacking gas pumps or restaurants card machines and is getting my card numbers and creating their own cards with magnetic strips. Either this or the merchant is going by different names that I don’t recognize.. maybe I’m paranoid.. which I doubt. 

My question is… would the bank close my account for putting my 5th dispute over a 7-8 month span? The amounts are small but it adds up. ",1728199386.0,0,5,1fxb1ua

I was doing well in my career, I already had a car but thought I should treat myself and bought a car I didn't need. I love the car. I financed a portion of it, put down a $20k down payment and traded in my old car.

My loan on this car is ~$50K. I've had the car for about 2 months now and have had extreme anxiety over the debt I've taken on. I can afford the monthly payments on the car, but how much of that is being lost to interest on the car is whats bothering me (my rate is about 6.54%). I also do have the ability to pay off the car right now if i needed, but this would result in me dipping into money i've received from RSUs, something that I was originally using to save for a house. This is not debt i can't afford to remedy, but I worry that I made mistake with this.

I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to sell the car to get out of debt and ease my anxiety. I did some math, and if i were to sell the car, this whole thing would cause me about a $30,000 hit.

personalfinance,Should i buy a small house to rent now or wait 5 more years for a house that i would want to live in?,"Hey everyone, let me give a little context first.

+ I live in a 3rd worldish country with a collapsing/recessing economy and incredibly unreasonable taxes so goods like cars or electronics are 3x price of their original price in US and even some basic needs like meat, water etc. are more expensive here than US due to taxes. 

+ I grew up, studied, and worked in poverty i am almost 30 and managed to get a remote job that allowed me to save some money (~30k). I also moved back in with my parent to save more money i am paying for my moms expenses rather than rent.

+ This saved money + a really low affordable credit (mind you that i can also afford any maintenance fees taxes with the current budget) will allow me to buy a small studio or 1 room apartment in my hometown. And it would be really close to college/university and can virtually be rented at all times to students due to them not having other accommodations here.

+Problem is that i don't want to live in my hometown i want to move back to the bigger city i was previously living in and a house there would cost ~4x more and would require me to work at least 5,  maybe more years to be able to afford there.

Since housing prices keep increasing here, do you think i should buy the small house now just in case and rent it, then sell it for the bigger house when i saved up enough money OR should i keep the money safe and wait until i can afford a house in the city that i want to live in?

ps: I keep my money in foreign exchange since local currency loses value daily, and investing in local stocks is not an option due to that. Thats why i wondered if it would be good to invest in a small house now but i am not sure.

personalfinance,"Laid off, what to do with money","I'm a 35-year-old married male with two young children. I was recently laid off and have been struggling to find a new job due to the tough job market (just for context).

I have around $450k in retirement accounts and recently started 529 plans. Additionally, I have over $400k in a taxable brokerage account and about $250k in cash. I've been saving this money for a significant investment, either to take advantage of a major market downturn, like a COVID-style crash, and invest in index funds, or to buy an investment property.

On top of that, I'll be receiving about $150k in severance, which I hope to invest but will also need to live off until I find a new job.

The difficulty in securing a job right now has my mind exploring different possibilities. I would love to make a significant investment with my cash to achieve substantial returns, providing me with more freedom and flexibility instead of re-entering the corporate grind, where competition for each role is intense. I'm generally risk-averse, which is why I haven’t invested those funds yet.

Because of a unique situation (beneficiary of a life insurance policy), I won’t be “needing” the money I earn from my paycheck for several months and I’ve been thinking about changing my 401(k) contributions. My work offer pre-tax and post-tax (Roth) options that I can do for my 401(k). I already match my company to their 3%. I can literally afford to put my entire paycheck towards my 401(k). I am 33 years old so and don’t plan to retire until 60-65. Would it be a smart idea to change my contributions to 100% post-tax Roth?

There was also the option for something called a “Special PRE-TAX” and a “Special ROTH DEFRL”. I have no idea what those mean. So if anyone could tell me that would be fantastic, too.

personalfinance,My family is going through a financial crisis and I don't know what to do,"Hi there. I'll summarize the situation as best as possible to keep my anonymity.

Basically, my father is being court ordered to leave the home, and because of this, we don't know what our next steps are regarding finances. For the past few years both of my parents got paid working as caregivers for my younger sibling, and my dad would get social security benefits. Now with my dad being asked to leave, we are losing a huge portion of the household income and don't know how we are going to be able to afford anything.

Here's the complicated part. My mom would still be getting paid as a caregiver, but I doubt that money would be enough. Most importantly, besides being a caregiver for the past few years, she has never had a paying job. She has only ever been a housewife and has little to no experience. On top of that, she is also almost 60, so I am worried that no one would hire her. She doesn't have a college degree either.

I could potentially find a job, but I'm also planning on going back to school this coming year, and I am looking for job experience in my related field, so that I have a better chance of getting into the programs that I want. However, those specific jobs are kind of hard to find, and I don't know if they pay well. On the other hand, I could get a regular old retail job, but then I wouldn't have much related experience in the program that I'm applying for, and therefore, may not have the best chance of being accepted into schools. And regardless how I contribute, what happens when I leave? How is my mom gonna support herself, let alone herself and my younger sibling?

And if my mom does somehow get hired, would I have to watch my younger sibling at home? Again, I'm looking for work/volunteer opportunities in my field, and I may have to be out of the home. I could potentially do it online as well, but I wouldn't be actively watching them, since you know, I'm preoccupied with work. They do go to school, but that's only for a few hours and the school dismisses them pretty early.

I don't know what the hell to do. We are stuck in this mess and I am so stressed and depressed. Please help.",1728188951.0,0,6,1fx8jwm
personalfinance,"I'm about to be broke for 4-8 years. Should I roll my 401(a) into my 457(b) so it's more accessible, or should I roll it into my Roth IRA where it'll have fewer fees? ","24 year old college student here. I work a seasonal part time job with a state agency, where I have a (mandatory) 10% 401(a) account and an optional Roth 457(b). It's now the end of the season and I have \~$900 in the 401(a), and about \~$350 in the 457(b).

I've got a year of undergrad left and then I'll be going to grad school for 3-8 years. Grad students stipends amount to poverty wages, and since they come from grant funding, they vary year to year and aren't guaranteed, there's a real risk of finding yourself without an income for a whole grant cycle. I'll basically be broke with no income security for 4-8 years.

For this reason, I'm being very aggressive with my saving and investing, and I've been careful to keep a lot of money accessible in the mid-term:

* I always keep 3-6 months of cash on hand as my emergency fund (I plan to increase this to 6-12 before grad school), 
* Any cash over $12K I invest in a taxable brokerage, as a backup emergency fund if I need more then 6 months (current balance there is $13K)
* I have an inherited IRA with about $9K current balance, which will supplement my grad school income, and from which I can pull from. if I need to as a backup-backup (I need to empty it by 2032 anyway). 

If I roll the 401(a) into the 457(b), I can use it as a backup-backup-backup emergency fund. This would allow me to increase the amount available to fall back on, while still keeping it in a tax advantaged account. If I don't end up needing it then I can just roll it into my Roth IRA after I graduate and have more secure income, an option I won't have with savings in taxable accounts. 

The problem is the fees for the 457(b). They're pretty bad:

* There is a flat $1.50 monthly fee, 
* An annual fee of 0.06% of assets
* The funds themselves have high expense ratios. 

If I rolled the 401(a) into it now, the flat fee alone would be 1.44% of the balance, and the annual fee plus expense ratio bring that to 1.67% (with the cheapest fund possible, which is a large cap fund that won't meet the risk profile of a backup backup backup emergency fund). 

Should I roll the 401(a) into the 457(b), do the same the next few seasons, and treat it as my 3rd backup emergency fund in case I find myself without funding halfway through grad school? 

Or, I could roll the 401(a) and my 457(b) into my Roth IRA. Next year, I could either do the same, or leave it in the 457(b), the balance next year should be a lot better since I'll start contributing to the 457(b) earlier and contribute 25% instead of 10%. 

Additional details about my financial situation:

* Living expenses: \~$2K per month.
* Annual income: $33K - $50K, between both of my jobs and student aid.
* Retirement: \~$30K, $29K in the Roth IRA, $1K in a TSP. I didn't mention these earlier because they're for retirement, and not something I think of as a potential fall back if I loose my income. 

Worth mentioning, if I don't get into grad school the year after I graduate, I plan to live with my parents and spend a whole year just focused on earning money. My internship will convert to a permanent position, making $54K a year, so I'd use that to max my TSP and Roth IRA, and put 100% of the money from the weekend job into the 457(b).

personalfinance,Should I sell my rental complex to establish myself financially?,"tl:dr I have a midwest rental complex worth around $450-500k, and owe $230k. It is cash flowing but the management has resulted in profits often being reduced, if not negative some months. Should I sell it to pay off debts and start life from a secure spot?

  
Hi personal finance community. I'm at a loss for how to proceed. A few years ago, due to the loss of a loved one, I received a sum of money from a life insurance payout. I used that money as a significant down payment on a rental property in the midwest through the guidance of a family friend who has significant holdings in the area. I believed this would be a solid foundation for my future wealth building endeavors, and many I've talked to have said it was a wise investment as it is currently cash flowing.

Fast forward to today, I'm currently working in the city making a decent income $100-125k(depending on bonuses), and currently have about $70k in debt. ($25k in student loans, $40k in a car, 5k of credit card debt). My rental complex, although cashflowing, is plagued by slow growth due to uncooperative management. 

Because the area I bought in is rural, I was able to find something that cashflowed very well. $6300 gross $4k in expenses (This pays for the mortgage on this property, plus two additonal single family mortgages, and insurance/property taxes). However, In the last four months, I've only net about $2k total (This is including an additional $900 I get from one of my single families) This brings with it the challenge of having good management. 

My current management team are very condescending and evasive when I ask questions of property performance or for explanations of expenditures. They often refer me to very complex owner statements that have conflicting numbers and have gone so far as to make me feel bad for asking for their time in explaining it. Normally this would result in anyone just hiring a new property manager and moving on, however, once more due to the rural setting, there are very few options, with the other primary option charging an arm and a leg in management fees, one-off costs, etc.

  
I'm of half a mind to sell the property, and use the profit to pay off all my debt, and use the remainder as a decent down payment on a house in my city, which would cut my residence expense from my current $2300/mo to around $1500-1700. I'd still maintain the ownership of two single families in the area, as well as plans to aquire 4 additional units through owner financing. But I figured that paying off my debts would really secure me going forward, as well as give me peace of mind. But I recognize I'd be potentially giving up financial peace later down the line with a paid off property paying me more than enough to retire on (comfortably, not lavishly).

personalfinance,HCOL Housing Dilemma: Buy or Continue Renting? Need Advice!,"First off, I’m fully aware this is a “privileged” problem to have, and we feel incredibly lucky to be in this position. That said, I’m stressing out over what to do next, and I’d love some advice.

TL;DR: Moved from a MCOL area to a HCOL city and trying to figure out whether we should keep renting or buy a home by the time our lease ends in May 2025.

Here’s what I can think of as relevant info:

Income: Dual income before tax/deductions is $300k (recent increase after spouse’s new job in the HCOL city; we were at $150k/year previously).

Previous city mortgage: $1600 (includes everything). We currently rent it out for $2000/month.

Current rent in HCOL: $3100 for a 3bd townhome.

Daycare cost: $2100/month.

Retirement savings: Maxing out 401k contributions and contributing to a 529.

Emergency fund: about 6months

Investments: About $200k outside of retirement accounts.

Houses we like are around $900k at a minimum anywhere within an hour commute. By the time we are ready to buy a house next year, I estimate monthly mortgage to be around $6.5k-$7k/month for a $900k home, including mortgage, taxes, insurance, and HOA (for calculation I just guesstimated interest rate of 5.90%) 

I don’t feel comfortable with a mortgage over $5k/month, but I also don’t want to settle for a place that doesn’t meet our needs just to save money.

Options I’m considering:

- Keep renting at $3100/month and save for a larger down payment.
- Sell our current house (starter home with an insanely low mortgage rate and pre-COVID pricing) and use the equity for a bigger down payment.
- Sell some investments to cover a bigger down payment (though I’m sure there are tax implications).

If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this? Any advice or things I should be considering? I feel torn because of our golden-handcuff situation with the previous home and current market rates.

I am 32 and making roughly $110k/yr ($105k salary with some incentive bonuses through the year) and I recently purchased a motorcycle for $7800 at 6.99% interest.  I have only had the loan since late June/early July and have already paid it down to roughly $6500.  Fortunately, I am able to put the motorcycle into storage with substantially lower insurance costs, which I will take to pay down the loan even faster for the next six or so months. 

I know everyone says not to drain your savings to pay off a normal loan (basically anything that isn't high interest CC debt, which I don't have), but I absolutely hate having debt for things that are wants and not needs.  I have just enough in savings (with the exception of a 3 month emergency bills fund in the event I lost my job, which I don't see happening but you never know) to pay the loan off entirely.  Debt for anything outside of a car loan or mortgage makes me anxious, which is why I typically take all my extra money and pay them off so quickly - things like furniture, new laptop purchases, cell phone renewals every few years, etc., I try to just pay immediately.  This loan is a bit larger than what I'm used to for a frivolous hobby purchase and it's got me a bit wound up.

personalfinance,At what point does it make sense to finance a newer vehicle instead of repairing a paid-off vehicle?,"Hi everyone,

I currently own a 2016 Nissan Altima that is paid off. I purchased the vehicle with 124k miles almost two years ago for $11,000 and paid off the car within six months. The vehicle currently has 150k miles and it has provided me with nothing but issues. Not including oil changes, I've put $3.5k in maintenance into the car since I purchased it—$ 2.7k of that was performed within the first 90 days of purchase.

While running errands today, my car wouldn't start and I had to have it towed to a Nissan service center. I'm not 100% sure what the issue could be, but it's most likely my car battery or alternator. Using another battery and jumper cables did nothing though. I'll find out what the issue is on Monday when they run a diagnostic.

Anyway, this has got me thinking: At what point should I cut my losses with this car and finance a newer one? I bring in $3,400 before taxes, and $2,200 after taxes, deductions, and my 401(k) contribution.  I am living with my parents for the foreseeable future and they do not charge me rent. My only bill is car insurance, which is $270/month (I'm 21 years old and this is the cheapest insurance at this time for full coverage)

If the repairs on the vehicle aren't too major, I could probably get $3,000 by selling to a private party. I have $11k saved up as an emergency fund, and I would only feel comfortable taking $2-3k from my emergency fund to cover a down payment amount with the expected proceeds from the sale.

Any thoughts? Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,I visited a dental office for dental services without knowing that the provider was out of network and ended up getting claims that I have to pay full amount without insurance.,"I'm an international student living alone in the US for 6 years. I thought I was adjusting to life in the US and becoming somewhat fluent in English after coming to the US for 6 years, but it was a big mistake. Now, I will tell you why I thought it was a big mistake. I have never been to the dentist since I came to the US, so I decided to go to the dentist after finding out that I had a bad cavity. I am enrolled in the BCBS Student Blue Plan, which includes the BCBS Dental Blue Subplan provided by my university. I asked the dentist I chose if my plan was in the network. So I made an online appointment for September 17, 2024 as a new patient. However, I should have carefully checked if my dental subplan was applicable to my age even though my plan was in the network .

At the time of my first visit as a new patient, I provided my insurance information, and the receptionist accepted it without informing me that they were out-of-network. As no mention of this out-of-network status was made, either before or after the treatment, I believed that the services provided would be covered under my plans. Additionally, I was not provided with an estimate for the Diagnostic Imaging, Preventive Services, or Oral Evaluation, nor was I asked to pay for these services at the time. Based on this, I reasonably assumed that these services would be fully covered by my plan.

Following these preventive services, the dentist informed me that five cavities were found and recommended that they be treated with resin fillings. I was told that the resin filling process would require two visits, and I was given an estimate for the first and second visits. The first visit on September 25, 2024, was quoted at $198.02 after in-network insurance, down from an original charge of $1,301.00. The second visit was estimated at $105.16 after in-network insurance from an original price of $770.00.

I visited for the first resin fillings on September 25, 2024, and promptly paid the amount of $198.02 for the resin fillings on that date.

It was only when I later logged into my Blue Cross Blue Shield account on October 4, 2024, that I learned both the claims from my September 17 and September 25 visits had been denied. The claims were for $587.00 (Diagnostic Imaging, Preventive Services, and Oral Evaluation on 09/17/2024) and $1,301.00 (resin fillings on 09/25/2024), both of which were denied on the grounds that the provider is out-of-network. 

So, I contacted with BCBS why my insurance was denied from the dental office on 10/04/2024. They said my plans cannot cover the dental services because the plans wasn't applicable to my age. And they explained my dental plan was just applicable for under 19. I was so embarrassed that I didn't even read the insurance policy carefully just to get my cavity treated quickly. I told them the dental office didn't inform me the claims before or after the treatment. But they gave me some options to discuss with the dental office or submit an appeal form.

So, first I reached out to the dental office on 10/05/2024 to clarify the situation. The person who answered the phone was a regular employee not supervisor. I asked to speak to her supervisor, but he said the supervisor wasn't in the office because it was Saturday. She said she couldn't know the details why I got these claims because she wasn't a supervisor, but she explained to me to the best of her knowledge. She said my dental plan does not cover these services, and, unfortunately, no financial assistance or discount program could be applied. I was also informed that I would need to find another dental insurance plan to cover the remaining amounts, but I do not currently have any other dental insurance. She said if I want to discuss this problem with her supervisor, I have to call the dental office on weekdays(10/07/2024).

I know it is my responsibility to make sure the provider is in the network. But I was led to believe that the service would be covered because they accepted my insurance card at the time of service. The lack of this communication before and after treatment significantly affected my ability to make informed decisions about my care.

The claims are very expensive for me compared to my financial situation. What should I do? I don't know how to deal with this problem.",1728167639.0,0,27,1fx2696
personalfinance,Wife getting a raise - Apply to 401K or HSA first,"The title of the post pretty much asks the question.  My wife (47F) and I (36M) know we're behind on retirement savings, but haven't had the financial space to really put money into it beyond getting employer matches on 401Ks and putting enough into the HSA to cover the family deductible each year.  We're finally in a pretty good place, kid's college savings in place, a small emergency fund ready, and my wife is getting a 10% raise.  We plan to put all of the raise into a savings vehicle of some sort.  I'd always assumed that we would just apply the entire raise to the 401K as our best bet, but I've heard some people say the HSA is such a good savings vehicle, especially if you don't have a huge emergency fund (ours is about 15K in a LCOL area).

personalfinance,Invest or pay down debt,"Don’t judge my bad decisions.  I know what I’ve done wrong 

I’ve got $150k sitting in a brokerage account invested in various ETFs. 

I also have:
$360k mortgage on a 2 year old house
$1400 car payments ($76k balance, about $20k underwater)
$2300 monthly child support 

Couple of options I’m floating around:

Cars: pay off to free up the $1400/month. Equity is trash, but at least that monthly bill will be gone, and I can invest $1400 or pay towards mortgage principle 

Mortgage: 2 option: 1) pay $100k towards mortgage, recast saving me $900/month in payment and saving $75k interest over life of house.  The $100k will live in equity should I ever need a heloc or cash out refi, 2) $100k payment towards principle, reducing interest life of loan by $225k and cutting 12 years off loan

Leave in investments. The interest gained will be better than any savings garnered from above. 

Buy an smb or short term rental trying to grown income.  

I imagine just leaving it is probably the best option, but there’s likely some peace of mind gained from getting rid of debt and having a cushion in my monthly budget

personalfinance,Should we pay off our mortgage?,"As younger people, we bought an inexpensive house in 2003 and somewhat foolishly accepted an adjustable rate mortgage. Over the years, that ARM didn't do too badly by us--but we didn't refi (I know) and are now at 7.8%. We have 30 k left on the mortgage, no consumer debt, and 100k in a high yield savings account (5%), plus 20-30 k in checking. Should we pay it off? The house is probably worth 200k (like I said, we bought an inexpensive house) and we are paying about $700/month.   
  
More background: One child is a junior  in college (paying about 20k/year) and the other is 16 and will attend college. We have 11k in a 529 for him and 11k in a 529 for his sister (haven't touched this yet and may not). I am wondering if paying off the house is a smart idea in that it makes us look less liquid to colleges.  
  
My spouse has a pension worth about 500k from a  previous job, plus some retirement at his new job (about 20k right now), but I have significantly less in retirement savings due to having been a SAHM (about 100k). I am now the higher earner and our current income is about 170k. We are putting the max into my Roth IRA and I am putting up to my employer match in my 401k (I think this is about $700/month). So, our retirement could be better, but could be worse. We are not knowledgeable about investing.

We are also likely (not guaranteed....stuff happens...currently our parents are 80+ and independent) to inherit about 300k (combined) from parents' estates in the next 10 years.

personalfinance,Reaffirming mortgage after Chapter 7 bankruptcy.,"Due to the death of my husband, medical bills and other expenses, I declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy last July. After the initial filing, I was sent some papers to reaffirm my mortgage which was sent by a law firm representing the mortgage company. I signed the formed, sent them back and received confirmation of them receiving them. The bankruptcy was discharged on September 25. I have repeated tried to contact the mortgage company by phone, but as soon as I punch in my loan number, it disconnects the call. I have gone online to see what the status is, it says the account is restricted and I cannot access any information. 

My question is, how long does to process usually take before I can start making payments again. I have put aside the money I would normally be making payments with, so if they require a lump sum to catch up, I'm okay there. I also understand they have the option of adjusting the payments higher to make up the balance. Either way is okay with me.

* I know I'll have to pay income tax on my 403b, but do I have to pay any penalties for taking it out early?
* Will this contribute to the $7000 annual max on Roth IRA contributions? 
* Is there a limit on how much I can rollover?

Pretty new to all this as I just graduated from my PhD and have a big boy job now. My wife and I just moved to the US, and are trying to navigate the maze that is retirement planning, so if anyone has any suggestions please let me know. 

Combined our income is approx 280k pre tax. This is what we’re thinking of doing: 

Max out IRA first. Then deposit pay-checks into a joint debit account that we plan on keeping 15k in at the start of every month. 

Transfer anything over 15k into medium term and long term investments. 20% 80% respectively. 

Pay rent/bills/various expenses using a credit card tied to the joint account. We should never go over 15k unless there’s some sort of emergency, on average we’re expecting to spend about 6k per month. 

Is that pretty reasonable?

On the other hand, I’ve seen videos of well-known stock market investors like Warren Buffett saying that he is happy with owning only one home and that more homes just lead to more problems. And obviously he is very successful. 

I personally prefer stock or dividend investing because it’s simple and doesn’t require any extra effort on my part. I just don’t know enough about real estate or enjoy managing people enough to pursue it. After all, my mutual funds never call me about a busted pipe…

investing,My basic philosophy for day trading,"I'm a day trader, and I only trade options.  Whatever ticker I'm looking at trading, I have three charts pulled up that I'm viewing.  I use the daily, hourly, and 5-minute charts.  I use the 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, &amp; and 200-day moving averages and simple moving averages.  I also use bollinger bands with a two standard deviation.

Imo the 50-day moving average is the most important.  In general, if a stock is above the 50-day, it's bullish, and if it's below the 50-day, it's bearish.  The more it builds above or below the 50-day, the more likely it will continue in that direction.

I first look at the daily chart, viewing the high and low of the previous day.  A stock can not go higher if it doesn't take out the previous day's high, and it can not go lower if it doesn't take out the previous day's low.  If it does, neither then it's an inside day and will trade up/down in the previous day's channel.  The daily chart provides me with my initial levels.




After that, I look at the hourly chart to have a clearer picture of the levels for the day.  Using the MA, SMA, and BBs I mentioned. I'm able to see where the support and resistance are in the hourly time frame.  I use the hourly because it provides me with stronger levels and only changes each hour.  If a stock starts moving above or below a strong support/resistance, then I know where the price is most likely to go.  Finally, I watch the 5-minute chart to see where the short-term support and resistance are.  One of the most important things is to know these levels and also know your risk.  I don't put on a trade every day, but I do watch the charts and look for the best setups with the highest probability for a larger move is at.  When I go into a trade, I expect to make money.  It doesn't if the price action is up or down, I'm not a bull or a bear.  I'm a trader, and I'm only concerned with making money.  I usually take at least ten contracts.  When a trade goes in my favor, I start securing profit based on the level I expect it to go to, and I'll keep some runners in case it continues in my direction.  If a trade goes against me, I will cut it for a small loss.  Before I enter a trade, I know where I want to start taking profit, and I also know how much risk I'm willing to take if it doesn't go my way.

Trading isn't easy, and nothing is guaranteed, so I secure profit and cut losses quickly.

I keep a close eye on the QQQ, futures, and the market as a whole.  I only trade a few tickers in general.  Since I'm an options trader, my preference is to trade beta names with high liquidity.  I don't want extreme volatility, I want orderly movement within the levels I'm viewing.  I have lost a lot of money in the past, and I've learned that in order to have success, you need to put in the hard work that's required to have success.  I quit being stubborn, I'm not a bull or bear, I'm a trader.  I could care less what a stock is going to do next week.  I'm willing to flip on a dime if the charts tell me to. 










I'm a day trader, and I like to use a simplistic approach that gives me consistent gains.  I only trade mega cap stocks.  For me, I find that learning how these stocks trade helps me to identify the personality of this group.  I'm familiar with them and how they generally trade.  I look for quality setups with the highest measured potential.  I have some basic rules that I use.

1 - Patience 
You don't have to trade just because the market is open.  If there aren’t any quality setups, I don't trade.  The market is going anywhere.  

2 - Less is more
You only need one.  By finding the best quality setup with the best measured potential, I do better than trading multiple subpar setups.

3 - Secure profit and minimize loss
Before I put on a trade, I have a plan.  I know the measured potential, and I take profits along the way.  I'll leave a percentage on when a trade goes in my favor, but there's no guarantee it will reach that potential.  I also know my max pain. If a trade goes against me, I get out.  

4 - Forever a student 
There's no one size fits all in trading.  What works for me might not work for you, and that's OK.  Find a style of trading that resonates with you.  There are many styles of trading. Whatever style suits you best, learn that style and continue to develop your skills.  The market will throw you many curve balls along the way.  You need to be able to adapt accordingly and know what type of environment you're trading in.  I highly recommend having an experienced mentor with a proven track record.  Trading is a lot easier when you have a great mentor.

5 - Acceptance 
A good trader is not someone who is always right.  I mess up trades. Everyone does.  When my thesis plays out, I pay myself along the way. Being greedy is costly.  When my thesis is wrong, I get out quickly and minimize my losses.  If I am having a bad day, I accept it, and I evaluate what I could have done differently.  If I feel uncomfortable trading for whatever reason, I don't trade.  If I miss my entry, I don't trade.  On any given day, I'm looking at a few different tickers, and I take a trade that has the best-looking measured potential.  Sometimes, the trade only gives me a small profit or small loss, and I miss one of the other trades that I was looking at, and it really runs, and I miss the better trade.  Oh well, it happens, and I accept it.  They'll always be another day.  I hope sharing my basic trading philosophy is helpful.  I encourage everyone to continue to learn.  What works for me may not work for you, but it's very important to have a process, and there's always room for improvement.

investing,Reasonable leverage strategy ,"Background thoughts
So, I am in high cost living area, but living in a condo I own (mortage at 2.75% and not paying extra). The condo just what I need in terms of space. I could have bought a single family home, but that meant higher property taxes, more in interest, and a higher mortgage payment. I also wasn't too comfortable with a huge loan. Single family homes, appreciate more than condos. My condo only went up a few  % in six years. I do max 401k, backdoor Roth, HSA , and putting money on a brokerage account every month.

Question
One of the reasons that real estate appreciation (if it happens) is high in absolute dollars, is because of the mortgage leverage. Is there a strategy for prudently using some leverage to boost market returns? I was thinking a long the lines of using a small amount of margin or other loan.

- I am able to contribute 3-10% of my pensionable earnings to their pension plan.  My employer will match 100% of my contributions up to 6% of my pensionable earnings. After that, they will only match 6% for every dollar after.

investing,Dividend Irrelevance Theory,"There is a popular subset of the investing community that focuses on generating income through dividend paying companies. The goal is to create an income stream that can either supplement or replace active income from employment. Dividend-paying stocks often feel ""safe"" to these investors, as they provide regular, tangible cash payments, which activates certain reward centers in the brain. This stands in contrast to the perceived uncertainty and volatility of a total return approach, where investors must depend on fluctuating stock prices for their returns. But while dividends feel safe and reliable, there’s more going on under the surface. 

**Dividend Irrelevance Theory (Modigliani and Miller)**

The Dividend Irrelevance Theory, proposed by Modigliani and Miller (MM) in 1961, asserts that dividend policy has no impact on a firm’s value or cost of capital in a frictionless market. Under this theory, a company’s value is determined solely by its earnings power and investment decisions, not by how it distributes its profits. Whether profits are retained or distributed, the firm’s underlying valuation remains the same.

In an efficient market, a stock’s price converges to its book value per share plus the present value of its future earnings. When a company issues a dividend, it typically does so when it cannot reinvest its profits in any profitable investments. Therefore, expected future earnings should remain unaffected. This means that the share price should drop by the same amount as the dividend paid out, as the decrease in the firm’s cash holdings lowers the book value per share.

Empirical evidence, such as the drop in stock prices on the ex-dividend date, supports this theory. When a dividend is paid, the share price tends to decrease by the amount of the dividend, as cash leaving the company is reflected by a reduction in book value per share. This indicates that shareholders are not gaining extra value, just converting it from one form (capital appreciation) into another (cash). The key here is fungibility. There is no reason why $1 in the form of a dividend should be preferred more than $1 in the form of capital appreciation.

**The Role of Asset Pricing Models in Analyzing Dividend Stocks**

While Modigliani and Miller’s theory holds under certain assumptions, real markets have frictions, and historical data has shown that dividend paying stocks tended to outperform their non dividend paying counterparts. If dividends don’t inherently add value, why is this the case?

This is where asset pricing comes into play. I encourage you to see my post on Asset pricing for more information, but to give a brief summary, we have identified 5 factors which are believed to be proxies for excess exposure to underlying systematic risks that stocks with certain characteristics have. Stocks with higher exposure to systematic risk should have higher expected returns, as you are paying a deeper discount for future earnings. The risk factors are as follows.

1. **Market Risk (Mkt-RF)**: The excess return of the market over the risk-free rate (proxied by treasury bills)
2. **Size (SMB)**: The premium earned by small-cap stocks relative to large-cap stocks.
3. **Value (HML)**: The premium associated with high book-to-market value stocks (value stocks) over low book-to-market value stocks (growth stocks).
4. **Profitability (RMW)**: The premium associated with stocks with robust profitability over weak profitability stocks.
5. **Investment (CMA)**: The premium of firms with conservative investment (low asset growth) over aggressive investment firms.

Running what is called a factor regression, we can determine how much dividend paying stocks are exposed to the underlying risks these factors are proxying for, based on how a dividend paying ETF covaries with each factor premium. See below an example of this factor regression for Schwab’s US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD).

[Regression done on Portfolio Visualizer](https://preview.redd.it/y11ok31tmusd1.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e099f569509f42986d240b38bd9a351761e10f0b)

The regression results show that dividend payers have statistically significant exposure to the Market, Value, Profitability, and Investment factors, with high explanatory power (R² = 90.4%). The alpha, or unexplained return, is statistically indistinguishable from zero. This suggests that dividend paying stocks do not have unique value adding characteristics that cannot be explained by their exposure to these risk factors.

What this means is a dividend portfolio’s performance can be replicated through targeting the risk factors directly. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that dividend payers are safer investments, because this regression clearly shows that they are exposed to additional risk. See below a comparison of the returns of Schwab’s US Dividend Equity ETF and a hypothetical factor tilted portfolio with the same exposure to those risk factors.

https://preview.redd.it/uhifc7j0nusd1.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85ad46f5496dd6588a24aaa4440ef3ced5162665

You can see how closely they track each other. This goes against the conventional wisdom that dividend payers are safer. Dividend investors should reassess their asset allocation assuming they chose dividend stocks due to risk aversion.

**Why targeting risk factors directly is a better idea**

Given that dividend payers performance can be replicated by targeting risk factors like value, profitability, and investment, a more efficient approach might be to directly allocate to these factors through diversified factor based strategies. Here’s why:

* **More tax efficient**: Since dividend distributions are taxable, targeting these factors is often more tax efficient, especially in a taxable brokerage account. Capital gains taxes are only triggered upon sale and can be delayed into perpetuity, while dividends create an immediate tax liability.
* **Broader Opportunity Set**: By targeting the underlying risk factors, investors avoid limiting themselves to dividend paying stocks, which tend to be concentrated in certain sectors like utilities, consumer staples for example. This broader opportunity set allows investors to gain exposure to value and profitability factors across a wider range of companies.
* **Why Defer Spending Plans to Corporate Dividend Policy?:** Corporations never take into consideration your spending needs, so why rely on them? To repeat, the key here is fungibility. There is no reason to prefer $1 in the form of a dividend over $1 in the form of a capital gain. If you need money from your investment portfolio, you can sell your shares, and cater the plan to your needs. Dividend focused plans have no considerations of your actual needs.
* **Market Inefficiency and Behavioral errors**: Investors often chase dividend yields during low interest rate environments, driving up the prices of high yielding stocks. This creates a temporary premium that is unlikely to persist long term. The preference for dividend stocks during low rate periods might reflect that the asset is overvalued due to the behavioral errors of investors. By focusing on these factors directly, investors can avoid the pitfalls of paying a premium for what is essentially an income preference rather than a sound investment decision.

Final note: This does not mean that dividends are inherently bad or that you should avoid them altogether. However, dividends themselves are an irrelevant criterion for investment selection. Investors should consider whether their preference for dividend stocks is driven by misconceptions around safety or income generation, rather than sound investment strategy.  A stocks value ultimately comes from its future earnings and risk characteristics, not from how it distributes cash.",1728095735.0,84,96,1fwgg7t

We make 140k combined total income, and have our first baby on the way in a few months. 

We already own a house with a 2.62% interest rate, and initially thought we’d use the 100k as a down payment for a house in the suburbs. The idea being we would rent our current house out and net anywhere from $1000-$1500 a month.

After house searching for a few weeks, everything I would want for a family home is out of our budget, so we started to think about other ways to invest that money. Should we just keep it in a money market? Buy a franchise? Invest in a business? Buy another rental property? 

We both have a dream of retiring early and somehow having a passive income. What’s the best use of this 100k to give us the lifestyle we want? How can we make this money really work for us? 

TLDR: Inherited 100k that’s currently sitting in a money market account. We have another 80k in a Roth IRA, and about 100k in equity in our current home. We have very middle class jobs and make 140k combined but we have no debt and we’re good savers.

-Buy a rental property, 
- Buy a franchise of some kind 
- Invest in some kind of turn key business? Maybe e-commerce?

investing,Is anyone else investing with Roots or have you invested in the past?,"For those unfamiliar, “Invest With Roots” is a REIT, based in Atlanta that is supposed to also benefit the renters by making them co-investors.  That concept appealed to me so I decided to try them, by investing in one unit!

I recently received a poly mail envelope with a scratch off card, a key chain, a couple of small company stickers and a post card with instructions on the scratch off and the keychain.

First of all, this is a huge turn off.  Don’t waste my money on gags and gimmicks!  I pretty much gave the company that feedback immediately.

The scratch off card was a bonus, only to be redeemed if you invested in another unit  (their nomenclature for minimum investment).  The keychain is supposed to be tapped on the back of your phone to reveal a “surprise.”  I couldn’t get it to work so I have no idea what my “surprise” is.  I’m guessing it’s like the digital business cards and just another marketing technique.

There is a high early withdrawal penalty if you withdraw your fund before a year, so I’ll most likely wait until a day after my 1 year anniversary and withdraw.

But, I’m wondering if anybody else has received some of these gimmicks, and would like to hear your thoughts or what your experience with Roots has been.  TIA!",1728082620.0,0,9,1fwc9fk

Apart from the whole ""you might be in a higher bracket later"" problem, is there any major consequence to strategically doing this here and there so you don't have as much tax to pay later on? Google's answers on this are a little disjointed to follow, and I don't trust Bots with this kind of nuance yet.

investing,I don't understand how inflation is calculated.,"When a publicly traded company issues new shares—whether through warrants, stock-based compensation, or simply by creating new shares without repurchasing any—the dilution is calculated by comparing the number of new shares to the original number of shares outstanding. For example, if a company originally has 100 shares and issues 25 more, we say the stock is diluted by 25%, regardless of any change in the stock price. If the earnings per share (EPS) were $2, the new diluted EPS would decrease by 25%, even though the stock price could have risen by, say, 10%. The dilution is still considered 25%, and this dilution affects shareholders, even if the rise in stock price offsets some of that impact.   
  
However, when the government prints money and increases the money supply, for example from 100 to 125, we don’t calculate inflation the same way. Instead of saying inflation is 25%, we look at the prices of a selected basket of goods (which changes over time) to determine the rate of inflation. In the mean time prices might only rise by 10%. In such cases, they would report inflation as 15%, but shouldn't inflation still be considered 25%, regardless of the price effects, just like in the stock dilution example? Since the people have lost 25% of buying power. If the economy became more efficient without increasing the money supply, we might have seen deflation of 10%, meaning the full impact on purchasing power should reflect a 25% inflation rate. Why does inflation accounting differ from how stock dilution is measured, when both involve an increase in supply that affects value?   
  
Saying that one is a security and the other one is money seems like a pretty cheap answer, since they both involve value, it just happens to be easier to buy bread with dollars rather than stock, but you can trade between them very easily.",1728038913.0,0,92,1fvw7yf

investing,At what point do you feel comfortable rewarding yourself?,"This may be more of a philosophical rant/question, but here goes.

Some brief background, I’m 34, my wife is 30 and we just had our first child a month ago. I consider myself a late bloomer in finances and career paths. I was lost in my early 20’s and had many obstacles trying to figure out a career. Never had a decent job to ever start really investing, I barely made enough to get by. Eventually I was able to get on a track and graduated with a professional degree in the medical field 3 years ago and finally have a decent job making decent income. My wife also graduated 3 years ago with her medical degree as well. 

We live in Southern California, I bought our condo 3 years ago and fortunate to have a sub 3% loan. We’ve saved enough to start shopping for our next home in the next few months and planning to rent out our current place out which should cash flow ~$500 a month. We’ve both played some catch up in 401k/403b’s and our Roths, but admittedly it’s not a lot in a relatively short amount of time; especially considering we bought our current place and saving for the next as our main priorities. My current job might be my longterm career as it offers a state pension as well. 8% of each paycheck goes towards the pension.

I consider ourselves blessed and very proud of what we’ve accomplished so far. But I’m having this internal dilemma over the last few months with setting selfish goals for the future. We all have vices and hobbies, mine happens to be cars. My goal has always been to save towards a cool (but expensive) car in the next 1-2 years. It’s the one hobby that has stuck with me since I was a toddler, and I’m as passionate as ever about em. And for the record, my wife is 100% supportive and encourages me to get something within the budget I was looking at spending.

However, as more time goes on and the more I save towards that goal, I’m feeling more anxiety and immense guilt with the thought of pulling the trigger in the future. Part of me feels that money should go towards some brokerage accounts to make up for lost time, or even possibly another piece of real estate (would obviously need to do extensive research to see what would be cash flow positive to make sense). And then the other part of me wants to enjoy life while it’s here. 

So I guess my grand dilemma/question for you all is: at what point did you feel comfortable (if at all) to spoil yourself? I understand for most people it means reaching a certain number, but I’m curious to see some other philosophies.

investing,IMCG vs XHMQ for mid cap portion,"This isn't really a ""versus"" thing. I'm just looking for some input for my consideration. 

I was going back and forth between IMCG and XMHQbfor a mid cap fund and landed on IMCG. I ended up choosing it because:

- it  had a lower expense ratio (this is not the most important factor to me, generally speaking)
- returns were good - not as much at certain year marketlrs than XMHQ but overall life of fund is more than XMHQ
- it had a 4 star rating on Morningstar, which was less than XMHQs 5 star, but IMCG also has a gold medal from Morningstar (this is a resource I like)
- it was around 95% mid cap vs around 55% mid cap for XMHQ and I thought it would be easier for me to balance between. Large, medium, and small cap that way. 

Today I decided to add some XMHQ. The overlap by weight between the two is 4%. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any input on pros/cons of holding them both, or if anyone feels I should hold one over the other.

My other funds are FXAIX, AVUV, and SMH. FXAIX is my core holding. This is all in my Roth. 

Also, according to Morningstar, my current portfolio holdings are 68% large cap, 23% mid cap, and 9% small cap. 

Mid cap is 11% blend, 7% growth, 5% value.

investing,Performance on the past 3 years,"I started to invest in the market around 2018. I tracked the performance of the S&amp;P500. I decided to put $250K with a wealth management firm in 2021. I was invested with them but around $100K+ until mid 2022 because with Covid I was concerned of the market collapsing. After reading reddit and other forums, I realized staying invested no matter what was the right thing to do. I started to invest more and more, but adding complexity. While my 401K was at 80% tracking the S&amp;P500 and 20% EM and International, on my wealth management firm, I invested in private equity, parametric (tracking S&amp;P500), HYSA, Roth IRA outperforming the S&amp;P500 (VOO+QQQ+others) and a managed portfolio under performing the S&amp;P500 by -5% this year.

Bottom line, if I check my 401K, I’m close to $500K and it tracked more or less the S&amp;P500 since 2021.

Now, If I check my wealth management accounts (parametrics, cash, roth ira, private equity, managed), I’m performing since 2021 at +30% compared to +80% for the S&amp;P500. I’m at $1.3M on that ones. But I think if I had the same performance as S&amp;P500, I could have been at $1.8M, assuming fully invested.

I was not totally invested so it’s difficult to figure out. Also couple of times I wanted to sell, or change allocations to bonds, or not invest, and my private wealth management kept me invested and now it’s working somewhat well.

I keep telling myself, yes, but what if I was able to stay invested like my 401K without doing anything?

This fund tracks the FTSE World North America Index with income reinvested.

But jumping ship from my current employer is not a given, and would only be considered if I don't get this promotion... So perhaps diversifying would be a good precautionary measure.

I’ve also been examining fee’s recently and noticed the s&amp;p fund has expense ratio of .54% and the other two are double that. The s&amp;p has outperformed the other two funds the last couple of years, possibly due to lower expense ratio, but im not completely sure why because some holdings overlap. The other two include a tech fund and a large cap type main street fund. There’s certainly overlap in the 3 funds. My question is do I push all my chips into one basket, my s&amp;p 500 fund that I like, or is it crazy to only have 1 securities fund in a retirement account, albeit a diversified fund with a low expense ratio.

A family member came to me with this website. ""Hey look at this, up to 10.5% returns on investments."" Immediately I was skeptical. I wanted to ask the community if anyone else has heard of this company?

  
My first thoughts when I opened the page was that it seems like a scam. There aren’t any details on the Odyssey Term Deposit. They are providing a 6.5-10% “insured” return in a world where government insured rates are 3.7% (the current ten-year government bond yield). They also do not detail what exactly is insured. The FDIC provides a principal and interest guarantee. The Yield website does not state what the insurance covers. I would guess they are taking client funds and investing them in the stock or real estate markets to generate those kinds of returns while advertising these investments as fixed income vehicles. The site offers other wealth management investments but is very light in the details. I think the biggest red flags are as follows: I can’t find much information on it online (IE reddit). Their website seems to only have been created a month and a half ago and it was focused on “A commitment to innovation and sustainability”: [https://web.archive.org/web/20240816174915/https://yieldwealthmanagement.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20240816174915/https://yieldwealthmanagement.com/)

Good investment and advice?

I have the opportunity to purchase a duplex for $285,000 in North Carolina. Both units are currently being rented. One is on a month-to-month and the other just signed a one year lease last month in September. The new lease is earning $1200 a month and the other unit is on a month-to-month lease. If I were to purchase this property with a minimum down payment of 5%.. my monthly payment is estimated at $2125.89.
My cost to close is estimated at $22,410. given that I have a guaranteed $1200 a month income, if I were to replace the month-to-month occupant and use this as my primary residence, my monthly payment would be $925. The house is no-show until under contract. It is about a 300 square-foot downsize from my current apartment, but I may be willing to make the move if this would be a good investment. this is my first property, so I want to be sure that any decisions that I make will be good ones so if you have any advice for me as a first time homebuyer interested in going this route please let me know.

So when a business reach there expected earnings for the year does that mean that they beat the Sp500 or match it?

Like those 4 overall makes more money than Ulta &amp; Costo so why are they less?

Is it because they are younger?

Also should I care about a stock share costing so much. To be honest Costco is a great business but since there share is so much it kind of scares me to invest in it.

In total probably cost 5 grand. Learned my lesson. Anyways I live in Phoenix. At first it was winter and I was managing getting around on the bus. It took longer but I just had to plan outy errands more. Then summer hit it became unbearable standing out In the sun at a bus stop. Anyways long story short now that I paid off everything and can get my license back I've been saving for a car. My original goal was to get a 5 grand car. Because I need to pay for the breathalyzer. That plus a payment with shitty APR and insurance would be alot. But now I'm kinda nervous. A co worker has what I'm guessing is a 2014 or so Chevy Malibu. 120k miles and it broke down and is now junk. For 5 grand I would probably get a similar car. I would try to get a Toyota or Buick with the v63800. But still you never know. So I looked into poetentialy  putting 5 grand down and getting a 11-14 grand car. Something simple. Something with 50ish thousand miles. After my current basic essential expenses I have roughly 1000 a month. A payment would be roughly 250 plus about the same for Insurance. Plus 125 for the breathalyzer. I suppose I can afford that but it leaves very little wiggle room for other things in life that happens. Let's say I get a 5 grand car. Insurance would be roughly 160. But more potential for costly repairs. I'm starting to think I just simply can't afford a car. But the catch is I took this job because I could ride a bike to work. I am underpaid but beggers can't be choosers if I have a car I believe I could make another 2-3 dollars a hour. I don't know. I have six months to decide. Maybe something will come along. Some one I know is selling their car. This would be miracle. Especially for cheaper used cars I know model year and make play a factor. But a huge factor is if it was maintained properly. Big difference between a car owned by one person and maintained it well then a car with a mystery amount of owners poetentialy beating it up and not caring. I'm trying to find a part time job. Would love to get to like 11 grand and buy a lower mileage used car in cash. Should lower insurance a bit as well. I don't know I really don't want to deal with another summer here with out a car. But I definitely don't want to save up for a car and it be junk. Or get a car with payments and have very little wiggle room for anything else that comes up. ,1728162571.0,1,11,1fx0ft5
personalfinance,Rental Car Reimbursement,"Hey guys,

Yesterday I was hit by a driver who ran a red light. The driver stopped, we exchanged info, got a police report, the whole nine yards. While he was attempting to dispute that the light was red for him, I have it all on dashcam very clearly showing I had the right of way and he ran the light.

Issue is, since this happened on a Friday, my claim isn’t being investigated over the weekend. I was wondering, if I book a rental car and pay for it out of pocket, am I able to get reimbursed once liability is determined? Original plan was to use my insurance to get the rental car and have them pursue the other company, but unfortunately I just found I do not have rental car coverage as part of my policy.

personalfinance,Company 401(k) missing after-tax option - How common is this (for smaller publicly traded companies)?,"My company's 401(k) offers pre-tax, traditional, and Roth options, but doesn't have the after-tax contribution option that would allow for the mega backdoor Roth strategy.

I'm wondering:

1. How typical is it for a company to offer a 401(k) without the after-tax contribution option?
2. For context, my company is publicly traded. Does anyone know why a company might not offer the after-tax option for 401(k)s?
3. Does it actually cost the company a lot of money to set up and administer the after-tax option?
4. Should I consider advising HR to add this benefit? If so, what would be the best way to approach this conversation?

I'm curious about the potential reasons behind this decision. Any insights from those familiar with 401(k) administration or company benefits would be appreciated!",1728161538.0,0,14,1fx02mn
personalfinance,"Saving as a First Step, Delayed by Human Error","You all have surely read the job reports for September. I'm freelance, so things are usually tight. But I had an unusually nice run for the 2nd half of the month working every day minus 2, starting the 15th. Though none of the clients/employers know one another, the money has so far not reached me except in a trickle. I'm aware it's become commonplace for business to generally slow down pay in the interest of preserving their cash flow over their service providers'.

One client had me set up a ""supplier"" onboarding account with its own setup guide, only to waste a week when one of 4 people at that company reached out asking if I had any problems with setup? (I had completed it immediately, and questions since when I can expect my check from \~1 month ago has so far been unanswered). Worked another big job at Facebook and funnily, the biggest check in the middle of the work week has been skipped, even though I got the email scan for it on Monday.

All these errors have me so stressed and topping it, is the inability to pay rent on time. When, if all the different inbound pay would have kept its obligations and schedule, I would have been able to kept mine. This has just been part and parcel of my life though -- not that there should be any knock for being freelance, even in some of my full time jobs I've had to chase my pay. A real kicker last year was getting multiple ""Out of the Office"" responses when questions about the whereabouts of my pay was left in limbo. Man, I'd love to be out of the office, on vacation wherever. What kind of thing can I personally do to best their human error?

TL:DR - there's no hope to save or get out of debt if your employers are always late/systems like mail and the bank break. Any advice?",1728160812.0,0,4,1fwzt85

personalfinance,Cannot afford my car insurance anymore,"I've been financing a car for the past 3 years and have consistently kept up with payments to both the car and insurance. However, last year I got into legal trouble and have begun slowly drowning in debt little by little. This, on top of an expected increase in my car insurance, is really getting to the point where I can't afford.

For some context: I owe about $13k on a car that's estimated to be worth around $17k-$18k but because of a crack in the windshield I got from a cement truck (that insurance didn't cover) I would expect about $15k or less for a sell. 

I owe about another $4k or so in other debt that has been messing with my credit score that I would like to deal with.

Again, because I'm mostly concerned with the cost of insurance, I'm not really considering refinancing the car. I've considered trading the car in for a cheaper one, but am worried that a few grand off the cars value wouldn't help me much. I've also considered getting a personal loan and/or selling the car to ""buy"" a car so that I could get away with just liability insurance, but my credit score has gone down the past few months and I'm afraid to ask for a cosigner, but will if that's an ideal solution. I don't NEED a newer car, in fact I love old cars, but finding a decent car for about $3k that I would get just from selling doesn't feel possible. 

If there's any debt consolidation loan routes, or other options I'm missing here I would appreciate hearing about it. I'm hoping to get some solutions from people that know more about the system than I do. Thank you.",1728159017.0,0,21,1fwz63r

personalfinance,Why is 10% yearly return (7% adjusted for inflation) the number people usually throw around?,"Most people I've seen talk about retirement planning throw around a 10% annual return (7% adjusted for inflation). But if you take a look at the S&amp;P 500 over the last 10-20 years, it's higher than that. I have two main accounts I'm invested in, one is a Roth IRA that is primarily invested in QQQM, and the other is my 401k through work that I have invested in a mix of S&amp;P and a JP Morgan Large Growth Cap. 

Obviously the stock market is always in flux, and we can't precisely predict the future, but I'm curious if the 10% number people use is to be conservative, or the fact that it's a nice round number that's easy to calculate, or if people genuinely think long term that's what we guess it'll be. I look at the average returns of the stocks I'm invested in over the last 20 years and they sit at around 16% annually. Even being conservative and saying I expect a return of 13% (10% after inflation adjustment), seems like a pretty stark difference.

personalfinance,Current grad student - large debt advice,"Hello!

This is my first time posting here but I am feeling very anxious about my financial decisions as I am only 23 and did not really think long term when enrolling into this program.

I am currently a student in the Hopkins MSN Program. With COA and cost of living in Baltimore, I will graduate August 2025 with about 120K student debt.

I plan to move back home to NC when I graduate Aug 2025 and start working immediately as an RN. I will not be paying much for rent (\~400$monthly) and I currently have no car payment/insurance/maintenance to pay for (thanks to my dad).

Background on me - I was not raised with much financial advising other than ""don't spend more than you make"" and ""save."" I have always had looser financial habits as I have ADHD and budgeting makes me very anxious. I went to undergrad for free and funded my life with refund checks and I owned a small business that allowed me to do a lot more than most at that age. I feel like that mindset has carried over into post-grad life, especially with this MSN decision + my waterfront 750 sqft 1bd apartment. I do acknowledge the importance of saving and setting money aside and I have about $900 in a HYS for dire emergency.

Because I am over halfway done with my program, I must see it thru. I am looking into all kinds of loan repayment programs and different hospitals within RDU area that will offer loan forgiveness. I would love to get a grasp on realism financially - budgeting, recommended books, student loan repayment, and just overall advice/encouragement. I desire to get my DNP and open my own practice, however, I am feeling so lost in the impeding doom this debt is bringing right now.

personalfinance,"Closing on a house in 2 weeks, and Im unsure what ""lender does not accept partial payments"" means","I am closing on a house in 2 weeks and i received this paperwork yesterday with a box checked saying my lender does not accept partial payments.

So if i want to pay extra on my payment does this mean every payment has to be over the minimum? I am paid bi weekly and pay half of each bill that i have each paycheck. Would i still be able to do this with my mortgage? If i make a partial payment what happens? I asked both my realtor and mortgage lender and could not get a straight answer.

My mortgage will be $1700, so i want to send them $1000 each paycheck but this box has been the most confusing part about this whole process.  I would think that would be ok but  there is another box that is NOT checked saying ""will hold in a separate account until you pay the rest of the payment and then apply it to the principal "" why is that box not checked?",1728149223.0,0,15,1fwvl1v
personalfinance,New Investor Looking for a Confidence Boost,"New Anonymous account. I do very well for my family financially but I've been scared to pull the trigger on Vanguard transactions.  
  
I am 27 and married with two children under 6. I own one home valued at \~350k. Both of my cars are paid off. I am in the military and make \~85k per year that goes directly to my checking account. I automatically put 5% of my check into a ROTH TSP every month and have it set to the automated L2065 fund (started it too late, \~2 years ago). Its been doing very well, about 11k sitting in there now. I have enough in my savings for emergencies and 35k sitting in a HYSA that's now at 37K. I do budget well but money is tight right now so I don't save a whole lot. Now on to my plan that I haven't pulled the trigger on. 

\~1.5 years ago I put 18k into a vanguard account (it's at 19k now, can someone explain why) and didn't make any transactions. I want to move \~10k from my HYSA into vanguard and invest \~27k total into the VOO ETF at one time and just leave it, I will set up a monthly contribution once the economy is better and money isn't so tight.

Is this the right decision to make? and is there any changes I should make? 

I feel like this will complete everything I want for my personal finances. The only other thing I want to do is set up a fund for my kids. I don't want to do a 529 plan. I'd rather do an ETF or Mutual Fund that would have enough money for college or anything else they want in about 13 years. Any suggestions? I don't have the desire to do any investing that requires daily or weekly decision making.

We need to set up some payment gateways and track taxes. Please let me know what I might be missing. Don't have finances to pay for an accountant to set this up right now. 

If this is the wrong place to post this, can you tell me where would be better?

##The Scenario

* Wife is shifting her career from an employee to a independent contractor (She is licensed, fully within 1099 parameters). 
* She will have two sources of income.  First is as 1099 contractor from the firm she is joining for clients seen there. 
* Second she will have her own private clients that will pay directly (this is the main reason we need to get some things setup because we want the billing software to go into an account separate from our personal account.)
* This is happening more quickly than we were expecting so we gotta get some things moving. 

**Here is our current plan, let me know what I am missing and any advice.**

1. Setup checking account for deposits. Can this be a personal account? Don't have an EIN for a business account and not sure its needed. 
* Cheap, simple accounting software (recommendations?)
* Set aside 30% of income  for quarterly taxes. Don't really want to pay for a second account for this but I will if we have to.
* Track Expenses (do i do this in the accounting software?).
* Figure how to pay her from this account.

57 y.o. man, recently on long-term disability due to a serious health issue that's manageable but may impact my longevity. Need to maximize my finances to prepare for age 65 when my income is cut by 46%

Monthly disability income **$5000**: $2700 from SSDI, $2300 from private disability insurance which will end when I turn 65, and SSDI payment estimate to be $3200 in 8 years at 65.

No debt, renting, monthly expenses total $3500, saving $1300 a month

**$175,000 in 401k**, as cash-balance, not *currently* invested in the market, but in a low risk/low return account.

**$100,000 savings in CD** at 5% soon maturing

**$125,000** more will be saved by age 65 by saving $1300 month now

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**I'm about to pull that $175,000 from 401k and put it into a multi-year guaranteed annuity (MYGA) for 7 years at 4.8%, which will be $241,570 at maturity.  For low-risk certainty**

**241,570** plus my projected savings will be **$466,570** by age 65, with a SS approx $3200 at that age, I feel I will be in decent shape and can make that last until 75-80, if I live that long.

I love the safety of putting what I have now in the MYGA annuity, but with the market being so strong I feel I could be missing out, but terrified of a drop and losing what I have.

What would you do? Is there a very low-risk option with the 401k that could be better than the MYGA annuity?",1728147696.0,1,11,1fwv0u9

I opened an account with Citizens Bank in person and the representative told me to go to their website and add my other bank and do the transfer that way (inbound?). That was probably the mistake. This was Sep 10th.

So I did, and the money left my Schwab account, but then I got [an email from Citizens](https://i.imgur.com/foM7AQP.png) saying the transfer was cancelled. The money, however, never made it back to Schwab. To make matters worse, I made two other transfers (which I initiated through Schwab) which went through correctly, including a $5,000 one on Sep 13th, so when I call customer service it's possible these successful transfers are confusing them.

Anyways, after getting that email I called Schwab twice, nothing. Called Citizens Bank twice, and they just said they did whatever they had to do on their end to send the money back, and now I had to go contact Schwab to file a claim to get the money back. So I did, I called them twice again, and heard that apparently the team responsible is only reachable via email.

* First, they wrote ""Will need to provide them with a trace ID for the return as there is no indication on our end that the funds have been returned""

* Second, they wrote ""The Bank Operations team got back to me much quicker than anticipated. The Trade number showing that it was delivered to the bank is xxxxx""

* So I called Citizens yet again, spoke to a supervisor, and they said they can't do anything, it's up to Schwab, and that I need to ""file a request to have the account credited and adjusted."" They also said that they aren't able to find a trace ID for whatever reason.

* Lastly, they wrote ""I do see that we received a request on 09/10/2024 in the amount of $5,000 on 09/10/2024. The transaction is labeled as xxxxx. We sent those funds and they did not get returned to us. This means the bank has those funds. Is Citizens Bank stating that they never received the funds?""

The Receiver is seeking authorization to take any and all actions that may be necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting requirements.
 
&gt; For all other foreign holders of Allowed Claims who provide a completed and executed IRS Form W-8, the Receiver will withhold up to 30% of the distribution for taxes. The amount withheld depends on the country of residence of the Claimant, and any applicable laws, treaties, or agreements by and between the U.S. and your country of residence.

I have a solid pension through state government for when I retire, and my 403(b) retirement account has an annual return of 7%. We do not have any credit card debt, just a mortgage on our condo and we are about to take on a new mortgage for a home we want to buy. We do not have children yet, but we are trying for them. I am trying to figure out the best way to use the extra $875 in income we will get each month from renting the condo after paying the condo’s mortgage and HOA fee and taxes etc. I could put it into a high-yield savings account, where I already have around $81,000 earning 4.1% interest.

I don’t mind changing stocks in the future, but since I’m young, shouldn’t I be more focused on growth? I’m not saving for anything specific right now and have a long-term investment horizon. I live in Singapore, so I don’t pay capital gains tax, but I’m aware of the withholding tax on dividends. Would a 60/40 split between VOO and VGT be a better option for long-term growth compared to just holding VT? Any thoughts on which strategy would be better for someone my age?

personalfinance,missing credit card and now was charged for transcations that aren't mine,"Lost my credit card after getting groceries on a weekday. Called my bank last weekend about it and had to refute charges on my card that wasn't mine. 

Now TD has sent me a claim update saying it was denied and will have to pay $400+ charges that wasn't mine. 

This is what they said: Our findings indicate that the individual responsible had access to financial information you are responsible for protecting. As part of your obligations under the terms of your product agreement, you are responsible for exercising due diligence in protecting your card, account information and the confidentiality of your PIN, as well as any devices and credentials you may use to access electronic financial services.

I understand that I shouldn't have lost my card. But shouldn't they also be able to tell that someone was using the card recklessly? Who can even shop $100+ in a store with no more than 10 mins interval from one store to another???

Can someone please suggest what I can do about this? I can't just suddenly pay for $400+ that wasn't in my budget. ",1728137565.0,0,9,1fwrb3y
personalfinance,Retirement Diversification ,"The last few years I've been maxing my 401k as my only retirement account. My company provides 4.5% match. This plan, if I can keep up with it, puts me close enough to my target retirement goals, accounting for inflation.

personalfinance,Estate Planning help ,"Seeking advice, nothing legally binding, just input to help guide my research and fact check a future estate planning attorney to ensure best advice. 

Situation: My mother is set to purchase property from my grandparents. With additional funding from my aunt she is building a home on it. Her goal is to use minimal funds from my stepfather. My mother is remarried and living in Florida with my stepfather. They plan to occupy this house together as a primary residence for their remaining years. My mother wants to ensure that this family property and future home passes to me and my sister (adult children) and not his adult children from a previous marriage. They are to receive the house my mom and stepfather currently share but will likely keep as a rental property. 

As far as I understand, because this will be a primary residence Florida law requires both spouses name be on the deed. 

What kind of trust, deed adjustments, arrangements, or co-ownership situation would most safely ensure this property passing to me and my sister regardless of who dies first and not include his adult children in any of it even if he were to want to change things after my mothers passing?

personalfinance,How to maximize new compensation,"I got offered a new job that increased my total compensation by 50%. Just wondering what the best strategy is to make sure I maximize my compensation. 


- 15% bonus at year end. I can contribute up to 75% of this bonus to an RRSP 

- I am able to contribute 3-10% of my pensionable earnings to their pension plan.  My employer will match 100% of my contributions up to 6% of my pensionable earnings. After that, they will only match 6% for every dollar after. 

- I am able to purchase shares of the company. For every $10 I contribute, the company will match 35%. I am able to invest up to 20% of my earnings into this purchase share plan. Any investment made by me above 6% of my earnings will not be matched by my employer. 

Just wanted to see what everyone’s thoughts were. I think with these plans in place, I won’t be cash flow rich since I’m putting a lot of my earnings into the employer plans, but I can increase my savings quite a bit through the matching plans. Do I max out each plan even if I exceed the thresholds where my employer no longer matches? ",1728135548.0,1,2,1fwqml4

I saw on the web the fridge/freezer LG GBP52PYNBN that promises a consumption of 137 kWh/year according to the technical specification on the LG official website. That would mean a 118 euro/year of saving and it means that I would repay the new appliance in less than 7 years.

personalfinance,Credit score is trash. What can I do to improve my housing situation?,"In early 2023, my ex wife and I split up. At the time, I was making about $70k and she made about $35k. She was terrible with money, and everything she earned got blown on useless shopping trips. I paid all the bills, and often had to bail her out when she'd inevitably run out of money and couldn't even get gas to get to work. We ended up racking up some debt over the course of the marriage (two years) because my finances were strained from the bills and every time something came up, we had to put it on a credit card. We also bought a house together which ended up being a horrendous purchase. We had it inspected and they found almost nothing wrong, but after living in it for about 6 months, all of the hidden bandaids fell off and the house literally started falling apart, starting with the floors (extreme crawlspace moisture). We didn't have the funds to rapidly fix it, though I did try and was often dumping every spare dime I had into the house. I couldn't keep up, and when we split, we both moved out of the house because it was nearly unlivable.

We JUST finalized the divorce because when we split, we didn't have lawyer money and she wouldn't work with me on an agreement. She wanted money from me, and I didn't want to give her any, essentially. It was only after she got recently engaged that she finally agreed to a dissolution where with no financial obligations to each other.

The debt that racked up during the marriage, I ended up working with the two banks and settled for a lesser amount and a payment plan. But, until the payment plan is complete, they have that debt sitting on my credit report as ""in collections"". So it looks like I have $21k of debt in collections but it's actually $9k of settled debt on a payment plan between two banks. They wont remove it. So that looks awful. And ever since early 2023, I continued paying the mortgage and paying a guy I know to work on the house as I had the free income, but it was extremely financially stressful and the house hardly seemed any closer to being able to be sold. Eventually, I caved and reach out to the mortgage company and explained that I needed to do whatever was necessary to get out from underneath of that mortgage because it was killing me. It took about 90 days in loss mitigation but I worked out a short sale. My credit score has dipped to 500. It was 785 when I bought that house in 2021.

I literally just landed a new job, yesterday, making $150k per year in northern Ohio. I haven't even started the job yet - and don't start until November. I'm finally about to be in a position to correct some of these issues. But, much of the credit score staining is already done.

I know it's going to be a few years before I can buy a house, and that's fine. But I need to move for this job and every single rental place I find says that they have a strict 665 credit score policy for tenants. I've done some research and I see that many landlords have the impression that a low credit score with a high income is even worse than a low credit score with a low income.  
  
I'm probably being overdramatic here but it nearly feels like tanking your credit score can make you end up homeless. Granted, I'm not homeless because I'm currently renting a place that I got *before* my credit score tanked.  But I do need to move. What's the best approach both short term and long term?",1728134419.0,0,4,1fwq90y

I'm 32, F, HCOL making about 120k a year, with about 30k in a savings account. I have other investment accounts and retirement accounts- but that's my ""emergency fund"" levels of cash on hand.

At the end of 2023, I was in an accident that totaled my car- thrusting me into an emergency ""I need a car"" situation. I ended up buying a 2024 Toyota Rav 4 (\~$35,000). I put $18,000 down, and have a payment of \~400$ a month at 7.6% interest.

Also at the beginning of 2024, I went through a breakup and ended up buying a house, and living on my own for the first time in 6 years- and as a first time home owner, I'm nervous about depleting my savings too much in case of emergency home repairs or issues.

At this point, I have 10K left on my car payment, and I wanted your advice on if I should pay off my HIGH INTEREST loan, or keep the cash for emergencies.

Another option I thought of that may make me feel better is paying down 5k, and then 5k in the spring when I get some kind of bonus from work. Usually it's about 8k after taxes.

Logically I know that I have the money to pay off this debt. AND the interest im paying PER DAY is something like 2$ a day at this point, but emotionally I'm conflicted.

Anyone have any advice? Thanks in advance!!

Wife 32f makes north of 100k/yr on salary and I 28m bring in 90-100k/yr dependent on OT. 
We bought a house 4 years ago during the vid and have a good rate of 3.5%. Asking price 500k with a first time home buyers down payment. We’ve actively been paying off extra every month and just got rid of our PMI. We’re in a great up and coming area and with the recent boom the “real estate websites” value of our home is around 700k. We’re aware that’s not what the banks will base our value off of… I need to get a copy of the valuation that was done to remove the PMI on the house.

 Anyways, we currently owe roughly 420k on the house. We’ve recently discovered what a home recast is (it is not discussed enough). 
I have the achey feeling that now’s the time to capitalize on this magical equity before we settle and start a family in 2026 and want to reduce our monthly bills. 
 
If we were able to secure a HELOC of 100k at 10%(easy math numbers and also current rates).  Use 15k to consolidate high interest credit debt. Use remaining 85k to slash the principle on the mortgage. Reducing our monthly mortgage by an estimated 550 while keeping our interest rate of 3.5%. Then change our lifestyle for 12 months and basically voiding my income to pay off the 110k(including interest). Setting us up for less monthly bills when we decide to start our family. And saving us roughly 44k in interest over the life of the loan.

Special assessments are honestly something out of hell, btw. Definitely something I wish I knew about before considering a condo. It is the straw that is breaking this camel’s back.

Total take home income is \~7400-7900/mo depending on how hard I work.

I’m in the middle of a divorce. We’re separated, and both properties are my separate property, so they will not factor into a division of assets. I will have alimony and child support which I estimate will be \~$2,100/mo for the next \~16 months. Then only \~$700 of that will continue until my child turns 18.

I feel house poor. I was earning more when I bought the condo. But I lost my job and went 1.5 years unemployed (during the separation) which really ate into my savings. My current job (thank goodness) pays well, but is 85% of what I was making previously, plus I’m trying to recover from the job loss and absorb the divorce.

Condo is a 1400 sq ft. 2BR/3BA. Comfortable, but I don’t think it’s worth the $4,850 I shell out each month. Other than the emotional feeling of owning it (which I think is overrated), it’s feels like a typical apartment with a garage. And half the week, it’s just me, and most of the time I’m working.

   
(Here's where I want opinions/advice)

I’m considering selling my primary residence (condo) and renting a modest apartment near where my child will be starting school. Then invest the proceeds into a stable mix of index funds and keep the investment property going as is. I think the ROI on the proceeds and savings by renting can match any equity building/appreciation the condo would have. Mostly likely, by my estimates, it will surpass it over the timeframe.

Selling the condo and living in the SFR isn’t an option due to its location.

I can already hear the people saying that rents have never been higher, landlords can raise them to whatever they want and that I won’t be able to find something for less than my condo payment. However, I’ve found a bunch of similarly sized rentals for $2,200-$2,800. For those saying it’s not a good market, I have a realtor that I’ve used many times who thinks I shouldn’t have a problem selling it for a very small profit. A unit in my community recently sold for a nice price in only 10 days.

As for me, I’m pretty no frills. Like I said, I’ll be single, with a small child half the time. I WFH.

IF I stay at my current condo location, I will have a 1-2hr commute to drop/pick her off/up on days I have her. Again, potential rent for a 2BR/1BA apartment near her school is \~$2,600/mo, which would make that commute only a quick 5 min drive. IMO, the time savings alone would make this sell/move worth it. Also, on the topic of saving time, I’m so over homeowner DIY and maintenance. I love the idea of leaving fixing things to someone else.

For a long time, I firmly believed that home ownership was ALWAYS the way to go and that renting “was like throwing money away.” But after some thorough research on the math of irrecoverable expenses and opportunity cost, I’ve realized how wrong I was, at least with my current variables. BTW, if you’ve never investigated the math on renting vs. owning, you should check it out and try to look at it objectively. It’s pretty eye-opening.

I still love the idea of home ownership, but I don’t think it’s what’s best for my current situation. I believe I can thrive more as a renter, at least short-term. Thanks for reading and I’d love your opinions.

TL:DR – Home ownership has become too expensive, and I’m thinking about going back to renting.",1728110349.0,4,2,1fwkb8w

At what point should one consider stopping the weekly HYSA deposits and perhaps even start some pulling money from the HYSA and deploying into the market? How low can a HYSA interest rate even go? ",1727823684.0,206,187,1fu1qjr
investing,Investment account question ,"Hello all, 
This may be such a silly question but for some reason I'm having a hard time finding exactly what I need. I am about to purchase a home and was gifted a large sum of money for the down payment. All of the money gifted is not going towards the down payment though. The family member suggested we put the remaining money into an investment account and pull the mortgage from that account and put the money we would pay towards the mortgage back into the investment account. 

It seems simple enough but I am just looking for more clarification or advise. I could ask the family member but I want to show that I've put in my own effort. 

I currently have a fidelity individual go account that just takes care of itself, I put 50 dollars in it originally to see what would happen and it has generated a little bit of money. When messing around on the app though there is any option to ""pay a bill"" from that account though.

I also have a Schwab account that has both Roth and Traditional contributions from my time at a previous employer that didn’t offer a 401k. I currently make under $150k per year as an individual, so am eligible to contribute to this Roth (and I have in the past, but not this year yet).

investing,Anybody else investing mostly in companies whose products/services they personally use and love?,"I think mainly Peter Lynch was the one who among other great advice suggested that people should invest in companies whose products/services you or your family and friends use and love. According to his books Lynch often found investment ideas in everyday life. He encouraged investors to observe the products and services they use and consider investing in the companies behind them. That seemed like a great advice to me 20 years ago when I started investing and I haven’t regretted it since. Here are the companies I invested in following this advice and still hold:

Apple, Amazon, Disney, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nike, Uber, Mastercard, Nintendo

Now I’m thinking about Reddit lol. However, I’m not very excited about the prospects of it becoming profitable. Maybe a small position just to watch and see what happens in the future?

investing,Is there an opportunity in Air Canada?,"Right now you can pick up AC for the same price as immediately after COVID. They had a rough couple of years but 2023 was profitable, they just averted a major strike, and they're trading at a P/E of 3.8.

On the face of it, it seems like a good opportunity. They had a massive run before COVID, peaking at triple their current value, and nothing has really changed about the company's position in the market. Canada is a difficult market to break into, with long distances between major cities and a relatively small population. Discount carriers routinely fail: most recently, Lynx. AC has a de-facto duopoly with Westjet, and fares remain stubbornly high. Compare that to the American market, where AA, Delta, United, and Southwest compete in a meaningful way, with a handful of discount carriers nipping at their heels.

Presumably the market is pricing in a lot of risk for AC to be trading at such a low P/E. Opinions?

investing,Assessing an investment opportunity ,"I made a post a week ago about my experience while traveling in Europe for vacation. I went to a local electronics shop to buy an adapter for my MacBook (bought in the US) then I saw in the window used iPhones selling for roughly $400 (adjusted for currency exchange rates) more expensive than the US second hand market.

I was very curious and surprised at the same time thinking to myself ""wow, this is an opportunity to make some money flipping used phones"".

I did some research and discovered that parts of the reason why Apple products are expensive in Europe is due to VAT. I pulled out my calculator and did some math, as all EU countries have VAT less than 20%. Even after paying VAT at 20% and shipping, I realized that there's still a profit margin of about $250/device.

I learned that, in African countries and some parts of Asia, these phones sell for close to $1,000 more than the retail price in the US. Even after paying import taxes and shipping, there's still a good profit margin.

I'm not soliciting anything here, I just wanted to know what you guys think about investing in 2nd hand smartphones and if there are those who have experience in this market and would like to share their experiences, good or bad.

investing,I had a revelation about why I invest,"
This is my revelation:

1. I work and get paid in fiat. Now, I don’t go to work every day only for the money - that would make it to onerous. There is some positive social aspect to work and it does give some structure and helps with self-image etc. But fundamentally, we exchange our time for fiat.

2. That fiat which we earn in exchange for our time and effort is constantly getting devalued because of inflation and the governments printing money to keep liquidity pumping. Governments also like to print money to devalue their debt, especially in USA which has the good fortune of having its debt denominated in its own currency.

3. Hence, we can only win by taking our excess fiat (I.e., what we earn from employer less taxes and less what we spend to live our day-to-day lives) and buying various assets with it. 

4. Real estate is a great asset because we don’t need to pay in full for it up-front, and can use leverage to build wealth. For instance, I paid $500k down (which in turn came entirely from the profits of selling a previous house which I had bought for $40k down) to buy a $2M house as few years ago. That house has appreciated 50% (which is not a super high figure) to $3M today. Meanwhile I have paid off about $300k of the loan using a low 2.6% mortgage, so I have $1.8M in equity. My original $500k plus $300k = $800k has more than doubled to $1.8M.

5. Stocks is next. Been buying with every paycheck and now accumulated $2.5M stock portfolio, mostly S&amp;P500 index fund.

6. Bitcoin is the great diversifier and turbo-charger. I only got into Bitcoin in 2021 amid the previous bull market hype. But since then I have been buying Bitcoin every so often with fiat leftover after stock purchases. So, now I have 3.04 Bitcoin which at today’s $66k price is worth $200k. I will continue to buy a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin every month. I don’t know how much Bitcoin will rise over the next decade, but as long as it goes up faster than S&amp;P index it would have been a good move.

So, my revelation is to turn your excess fiat each month into hard assets - real estate, stocks and Bitcoin. Don’t hold too much cash. I only hold $100k in cash as emergency account. That’s all. Peace out!",1727582243.0,0,23,1frvuvk

I’ve been doing a lot of research and going back and forth for the past few months trying to figure out my best options and I thought I would see what kind of insight this community could provide.

I’ve started to focus on my future financial security; and in doing so I remembered I had a profit-sharing plan with a company I was employed by for a relatively brief timeframe after exiting military service. It has been about 7 years since I left the company and therefore have not been contributing to it. The account has approximately $14,500 in it and has grown on average $1,000 per year since I left the company. 

My question(s) is what I should do with it since I cannot contribute to it. Should I just leave it as it is and let it continue to grow so I remain more diversified? Should I withdraw it and put as much as I can into my Roth IRA? Should I transfer it into a different type of investment account within Vanguard that I have more control over?

I also have nearly the same question with my TSP account that has roughly $4,500 in it. I don’t believe I’ll be returning to federal service, but I’m not 100% sure, so I’m just not sure of what I should with it either.

A few things to note: I am 32. I do not currently have a 401k that I’m actively contributing to, only a Roth IRA. I am considered to be permanently disabled through the VA, so from my understanding I would not be subject to the early withdrawal penalties.

investing,Owning Shares in a Private Company,"Many years ago, I worked for a startup called Vision Critical.  I was given options which I ultimately vested and bought.  I also bought shares when they were offered to employees.

In roughly 2016, after I left the company, there was an offer for employees/former employees to sell shares to an incoming investor.  I was able to sell about half of my shares at a favorable price, essentially paying back what I had initially invested, with the other half remaining invested.  I only sold half because the number of shares you were allowed to sell was limited.

Since then, the company has rebranded as Alida, and I get financial statements as a shareholder every quarter.  I am not an expert on startups and funding, but it looks like they have had several more rounds of investment since I left (Edit: based on public information, not the financial statements).  I do not get any sort of statement on my remaining shares (not once as far as I can remember after the selling of share).

When owning shares in a private company, is it normal to not get information about your shares periodically?

investing,Commoditized and Cyclical Stocks: Trade or Own - Some Thoughts &amp; Strategy,"I was writing elsewhere about trading Micron and other memory chip producers rather than investing in them earlier today and thought this snippet would make a really interesting topic of conversation amongst this groups Redditors.

My basic premise is that even when sharing an industry where some companies share almost everything in common except some lean much more towards simpler commoditized products compared to specialized ones and because of varying degrees, lengths and runs/drawdowns tied to cyclicality. 

It was Micron's recent earnings that got me on the topic, and I basically argue that these stocks *can* make you a lot of money if you just buy-and-hold. However, they are likely to be better for your bottom line in the long-run if you trade them, specifically swing trading (usually over a 1 - 6 month period during which the fastest growth is taking place. Even cyclicals with massive long-term gains aren't as good as less cyclical members of the same industry with large expected long-term gains even if a bit less expected growth than cyclicals. Not only do cyclicals tend to gain a larger share of their total growth in only part of the cycle before possibly losing half those gains over the next parts of the cycle means that there is a major opportunity cost to just holding while they stagnate or fall month over month, and in some cases for several years. Moreover, you can better time the market with cyclicals than with most stock.

+The *nice thing about timing the memory market* is that the commoditized nature of most, but not all, memory chips keeps these companies closely in sync throughout their cycles - and one suddenly starting to get ahead of where the rest are is often a pretty good sign that the others will follow shortly thereafter. You don't get many surprises in a countercyclical direction. This is why I bought MU recently close to 80 and just sold in after hours right after earnings, very nice bit of profit for something I held for less than a month. Indeed, though I believe MU was probably a good hold for a couple more quarters - possibly more as this cycle should be elongated due to secular tailwinds - but it was always going to reverse course and if I don't intend on holding for a year at least then I don't like to hold onto the stock for very long. If I'm flipping it, I'm not waiting 9 months, I'm going to take hold of an imminent catalyst, buy as close to earnings as possible assuming that is the expected catalyst and sell either in after market or pre-market before the trading session following earnings begins. If you get your limit orders submitted into after hours before earnings are released, the moment earnings are released tends to see very large, wild swings in both directions in a very short period of time (less than 5 minutes, and lucky if that). Traders who don't smartly set limits try to ascertain whether to expect a big jump or fall within seconds of the initial numbers coming out while most people will not make moves until at least the next trading session. So right as earnings get released, the stock with earnings tends to see volume at its lowest for the quarter and therefore the sudden rapid fire selling and buying by every type of investor, hedge fund and algo.",1727532894.0,1,0,1frf7vs

I've had some money in mutual funds for a few years, but I have not really taken the time to learn and understand properly, and I'd like to be smarter with my money. So I've gathered that the golden rule is ""time in market over timing the market"" as most of us would not be able to time it correctly. By buying stocks/funds consistently over both rises and falls you get a better outcome than trying to time your purchases. But then there's also stop loss to reduce the losses to your portifolio - where you should sell if the stock falls below 7-8% of what you bought it for. Isn't that against the whole ""time in market"" thing? Or is ""time in market"" and buying consistently mainly for funds where it's diversified for you already?

investing,How wise is it to invest in the stock markets of some growing third world countries in order to get higher risk and higher rewards? ,"I have noticed in the past years that the stock markets of some third world countries have grown more, of course it is riskier, but somehow investing in these countries seems to me to be a sensible idea, even though the United States of America continues to grow, it is not so fast because it is already developed. But when we look at the third world countries, there are countries that have the potential to develop very quickly.

That's not the only reason. Also, sometimes there are important events that will increase certain share prices. If we look at the world as a whole, we can profit more easily than if we just look at events that happen in the US.

For example, something a head of state says or an action they take can cause specific stocks to go up or down obviously a lot. I believe that if I follow the world news constantly, I can benefit from it.

I can get an extra $300 in one hour of overtime at work. Why get so excited about $300 over a whole year when it took thousands invested to get that? Yes, it’s truly passive, but I really don’t see the hype? $1m invested in SCHD gets you around $30,000 a year. Ok, that’s $30,000 of passive income, but it took you *a million dollars* to get that. Is that worth it? Especially when comparing to if you invested a million dollars in the S&amp;P, it’ll have much faster growth over the long term and you can always pull 4% or more from that and have a “safe” withdraw rate.

Are people just trying to play arbitrage and if the price of gold increases, they'll buy any and all they can at Costco below market price, and just dump it at market to capture the profit margin?

Obviously I can't go to the bank today but I will on Monday and close my old accounts and start new ones.  Thanks again and I hope everyone has a good weekend.



**EDIT:**

First off, thanks to everyone who replied.  I read just about every reply here and a lot of them were very helpful.  A few things

1. The messages I got from Huntington Fraud did specifically mention it was my card being used and every time it's happened it's been the new card.  I don't know how much of a difference this makes but I've seen some suggest it's my account number rather than my card that was compromised.  It could be, but they're using the card still.  I wasn't just going through my account and noticing weird charges.  They caught them.
2. I don't have an SO or live with anyone.  Furthermore, and I should have mentioned this, but it's always someone way out of my state that uses it and buys weird shit like $50 worth of McDonalds Coffee from Office Depot.  So I'm sure it's no one around me that's getting a hold of my card.
3. I didn't mean to throw shade at the bank teller who said they didn't know how the card was being compromised.  While I understand she wouldn't know how my card specifically was being used, I just thought she might have some information on how to protect myself.  She told me about the card skimmers though and that was certainly insightful.  I had no idea what they were before then and now I know what to look for.  My mom was a bank teller for many MANY years in her life, and believe me, I know they deal with stupid people a lot.  My favorite story she told me was about the guy who came up angry that he was overdrawn and then proceeded to say that was impossible because he ""still had checks left.""  So i guess I was the stupid person this time.
4. To everyone saying ""Why is OP using a debit card??!!?!!?!?!! This makes no sense.  Everyone knows you never use a debit card and only use credit!!111!"" and acting like I'm a moron... well, growing up in the 80s before debit cards were a common thing, I was always told that credit cards were for emergencies only and you should only use it if you need to.  That has stuck with me but I see now that things have changed and using a credit card is the better option.  And it makes a lot of sense too.

And I know I'm going to get a bunch of replies now that say ""I grew up in the 80s and never used a debit card in my entire life!!!?????!"" but at least where I grew up, credit cards were emergencies only because of interest and the fact that it was easy to rack up debt with them.  But as I said, things have changed. Just try to understand that maybe someone was taught something different and that doesn't mean they're stupid.

Most people I know has had their card compromised at least once in their life, that's why I said ""it happens sometimes.""  If it hasn't happened to you... well that's great.  I hope it doesn't happen to you.  I'm 43 now but I was 42 when this happened and i went that long with it only ever happening one other time 10 years ago so... I'd say I had a good run. I've heard of it happening to people who haven't even activated their card yet so... sometimes weird shit happens.

Also with the invention of chip cards, they were supposed to be insanely secure and you just tap and go and no information is sent.  I never swipe my card, I only ever use chip and that was supposed to be the way to go.  You hear that all these things are secure and you can trust this and that and only do it this or that way, and sometimes it's hard to tell what's really secure and what isn't.

5.  To people saying ""Stop using your debit card everywhere!""... I'm being honest when I say that the latest card I got I barely used.  I never entered it anywhere online or on my phone and never swiped it anywhere and changed my pin and everything.  So, I'm really at a loss as to how someone was able to use it.  My best guess is the auto update thing.

6.

A.  I will be closing down my bank accounts and opening new ones.

B.  I will keep my debit card locked unless I need to use it for withdrawals.  I'll use my credit card and pay it off once a week now and keep an eye on it.

C.  I have a password manager now and I'm in the process of changing all my passwords and enable 2FA on everything

D.  I would like to check my computer for malware and would like suggestions on the best one to use.  I want to check my phone too but I've never entered my card information on my phone.

And I think that's about it.  If it happens again, I will change banks.  I just don't want to do that now since I've been with Huntington for so long and they've always caught the fraud charges right away and reversed the charges.  I'm worried that if I go to a new bank it won't be as easy but hopefully it just doesn't happen anymore.

Again, thanks for all the replies.  I appreciate all the help and will do everything I can to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.

Original post:

So hi there r/personalfinance  redditors.  I'm not 100% certain if this is the correct subreddit to post to but when I looked up information on what I was going through, this subreddit came up a lot.

First off, I know everyone probably says this but I do consider myself careful with bank cards.  I very rarely if at all use them online.  I usually pay with paypal.  If I do use a bank card, I don't have google auto save it, but again, usually I don't.  I only ever use tap as well.  I don't swipe my card anywhere.

So back in June, my bank card was compromised.  Huntington caught it right away and put a stop on it.  Not a big deal to me, it happens to everyone, although the last time it happened it was like 10 years ago.

I got a new card but then two months later, again, charges on the card that I didn't do.  I stopped the card again and this time when I went into Huntington I asked them how that could be.  It seemed crazy to me that my card could be compromised twice in a short period of time.  The lady there told me it could be a card skimmer at a gas station nearby.  She also says she sees this happens sometimes where someone will have their card hacked several time in a short amount of time and they don't know why.

I got a new card and this time I was careful.  I didn't even activate it for like two weeks because now I was nervous.  When I did activate, I didn't use it much as I used to.  I either paid cash or used my credit card.  When I did use the bank card, again, I would tap, never swipe.  I even examined the gas stations i went to to see if there were skimmers, but found none.

Then last week, once again, charges on the card that weren't mine.  I also got an email about an order someone placed on officedepot using my email address.  (it was a bunch of coffee so I guess this person is tired)

At this point I was just completely at a loss and didn't know what to do.  I thought to myself that i wouldn't even bother getting a new one, BUT I took to the internet anyway to look up why this could happen.

I came across two things

1. Skimmers.  It could be a skimmer somewhere or....
2. Apparently if a website with your card information is breached, it's easy for them to get the new card information when you get it.

Neither of these made sense to me and I couldn't figure out which website could have the card info until now.  I was going through old emails and I found one I missed from Ticketmaster...

yes, I had used them and put my card information in.  I went to the Sonic Symphony this year.  I'm sure that's how they got my name, email and card number and such.

But, the thing is... I don't know how to fix this.  I don't want to just not have a bank card, just in case but I don't want to have to change it every 2 months.... so my plan was to close my bank accounts and open new ones with a new email address.

Will that be enough?  Is there something else I need to do?  Sorry for the long post, I guess I got a little carried away but I wanted to lay all the facts out.  Let me know, thanks.",1728108710.0,569,304,1fwjxqy
personalfinance,Question about Splitting Transactions and Apple Wallet,"With MoneySpire I've set up a biz account and a personal checking account. I've also added a category called ""owner draw"" for when I take my own personal payments. I stupidly transfer money using Apple Wallet because right now I need the money faster than a couple of days. Unfortunately, this causes a bank fee on the instant transactions. When recording it in my register, I can do a split transaction with one being assigned bank fee but the other I can either have the category as owner draw or as a transfer to the personal account. I cannot do both. I need to do both. What would be the best way around this?

1. Make owner draw a tag instead of a category/  
2. Create an Apple Wallet passthrough account where the owner draw goes to apple wallet and the transfer goes to the person account?  
3. Do all entries manually?

I do not want the account grabbing the register feed from the bank and filling it in for me. This causes brain farts for me as it doesn't feel as hands on. If I did that, I might as well just carry all the apps on my phone and look at those in real time instead.

Which do you do above? Thanks",1728108691.0,1,0,1fwjxl5
personalfinance,I think I'm trapped in my house.,"Curious of what y'all would have done, and looking for ideas moving forward.

January of 2022 my wife finished her masters degree and received an offer for a job in another town in central Texas. She accepted the job as it was a considerable pay bump. So we start looking at housing. We initially looked into renting, but the rental market was much higher than what we were paying at the time so instead we looked at buying. Mortgage rates were still low and I'm a veteran so I qualified for my VA home loan (no PMI, slightly lower rate, and no down payment). House for house, buying was cheaper to the tune of roughly $500 or more a month. It looked like a no brainer. We locked in a 30 year fixed rate at 3.25%. Not bad I thought. Our mortgage is right at about 2K a month currently. Again, not bad. However, I've come to really dislike our neighborhood, this town, and frankly, this house. It's not a fixer upper, but it needs updating and was a rental for a couple years so it needs some love. My wife has recently stated that there are a few things at work that if take place, she might start looking elsewhere for a job back in the BCS area (still Texas, about 2-3 hours east of central Texas). We both very much liked it there and would be excited about the idea of returning. The issue however, is I feel like we have lost a lot of value in our home. we bought for 325K. The Zillow's, Trulia's, ect., are estimating a value of around 310K. However, there was a house quite similar to ours in our neighborhood, in a little nicer condition, that was on the market for a few months that eventually was listed for around 240k before being taken off Zillow. I'm not aware of any issues with the home to explain the devaluation, but I suppose that's possible. We haven't done a formal appraisal but I'm worried that we are significantly upside down on our mortgage. We currently owe around 300K. I don't see a way we could sell the house without losing our asses. I don't see a way to keep it and rent it out, nor do I really want to be a landlord. Are we stuck here for a while?

First, in buying the house, what would y'all have done differently, I'm open to the criticism. Understand, we bought fast because we needed a place quick, and houses were selling in less than a week. The market was nuts. I still firmly believe in ""buy the house you can afford"". You never fully know what the market is going to do and waiting around more often than not will price you out. 

  
Second, what would you do moving forward?

I got a disastrous medical diagnosis in 2020 and had to take on a lot of debt to pay for my medical care. My insurance did not cover experimental treatment so I had to take care of it myself, also I had to cover my living expenses for periods of my treatment as I ran out of eligible time. Fast forward to 2024 my medical condition has been dealt with to the point that I can live a normal day to day life. I however racked up about 130k in debt. My house is 400k, and my loan has a remaining balance of 120k. My rate is 4.25% (FHA). I would like to consolidate my debt, and reduce the monthly interest in my loans (avg interest for all debt is 19%) and it has been crushing my bottom line.

I have been offered a 4.65% interest rate for the refinance and we are pending inspection. My question is for my particular situation is the Refi+cashout the best option? I notice the mortgage people are thirsty for me to sign the dotted line.

The following is some milestones that happened since 

- paid off 20k for student loans (luckily interest free bc of Covid) 
- had an important trip and big expense that also cost me 20k 
- I have the occasional splurges and binge shopping 

- I did start investing a big chunk of my paycheck for my 401k and my Roth 401k ( about 40k total there) 
- only found out about Roth IRA end of last year so my fidelity Roth IRA was maxed out for both years and is at just over 15k 
- personal fidelity has just some money I put in to play with and have 6k 
And I have most of what’s leftover in a hysa and that’s about 60k

$10k Year 1

Grows to $35k year 20

$35k year 20

personalfinance,Is Megabackdoor Roth The Best Option When Young,"I have a lot of questions about optimizing retirement money.

When investing into a brokerage, then those capital gains are taxed at a maximum of 20% no matter what. Not bad.

For the megabackdoor Roth, I understand that I can put after-tax dollars into my 401k and then convert them to Roth savings. Without this conversion, I worry that withdrawing a lot in retirement would mean I'd pay higher ordinary income tax rates, which could exceed 20%. That sounds bad.

Now, with the in-plan conversion, those stock gains can grow tax-free -- Now, just to make sure, is it true this means that all of this money growth can be withdrawn from the 401k at ZERO penalty? 

As someone who is more than 40 years away from retirement (unless I retire early), the current money in my retirement account will alone turn into 21x what it's worth right now (assuming 8% yearly growth), and all of that is tax-free! This sounds way too OP. Is it really this true? 

And how much power do law-makers have to undo this advantage that currently exists? One concern is the possibility that the money in my roth retirement accounts  is no longer tax free during withdrawal if a law is ever amended.

Lastly, has anyone compared the benefits of contributing to a pre-tax 401k versus a megabackdoor Roth IRA based on their personal situations? I’m leaning towards the super-saver lifestyle, and it seems like the Roth option is much more efficient for long-term growth.

I didn't include the regular Roth IRA since I don't qualify due to my income, but is it treated the same as a Roth 401k aside from the income limits?

personalfinance,Decent car with pretty bad APR or buy a possibly unreliable car but in cash. ,I'm not in a huge rush. My goal is to drive by next June. I have a DUI and will need a interlock. It's like 125 bucks a month and I looked up my insurance.... Ehh it's going to be more expensive for sure but not nearly as bad as I thought. My goal was to just get a car cash. Save up like 6500. Have 4500- 5000 for the car some money set aside for taxes title ECT and hopefully have some money left for possible repairs. But I'm starting to think that's not the best bet. I have bankruptcy as well. I was just curious so I got a soft approval from a company I have a credit card with. The Apr is pretty high. About 19 percent. But maybe in six months with good credit history it will go down a bit. I still want to save at least 5 grand for down payment. I was just online and got estimated payments. I could probably afford to pay off a car I think would be reliable in 3 years. Nothing fancy just something not too old not too many miles. So I would pay money just in interest. But you never know with used cars. It may be great for 3 years. It may be a money pit.Repairs can add up quick. I can do little small stuff. Maybe YouTube it and wing it. But for the most part I am not great with cars. Hypothetically car breaks down. Needs to get towed. Few hundred bucks. Repair can easily be 500. Something more major? Might be half of what the car is worth. Blown engine or tranny? Costs more than car is worth,1728089187.0,3,20,1fwegak
personalfinance,Transitioning solo 401k from LLC to sole proprietorship,"Hi everyone,

I have a sole proprietorship (with my own EIN attached to my name). I also have an LLC (with a different EIN) which I've been operating for the last several years. I have a solo 401k sponsored by my LLC (established under the EIN for the LLC). For a variety of reasons, I am planning on shutting down the LLC and thus will need to terminate the 401k plan associated with it. I'd like to keep the funds I have in that 401k in a qualified plan (rather than rollover to an IRA) because I take advantage of backdoor Roth contributions every year and therefore try to keep the amount of before-tax money I have in traditional IRAs at $0 so as to not trigger pro-rata taxes. 

So I wanted to ask people here that know more than me -- if I open a new solo 401k plan sponsored by myself as a sole proprietor (and using that EIN), would this be subject to the Succession Plan Rules or would it not since it is technically a different employer with a different EIN? If not, presumably I could establish this plan right away and rollover the funds from the old plan directly to the new one?

I've got a bit of a unique situation and would appreciate some input.

Here’s the background: I’m an 18-year-old who graduated high school this past April. Right after that, I jumped into the workforce, going through a few retail sales jobs before landing my current position in sales, which pays $47k a year. Not bad, right? Especially since my living expenses are practically nonexistent. I still live at home, only paying for gas and whatever else I want. My parents cover the big stuff like car insurance, phone bill, and food, and they don’t charge me rent. So right now, I’m able to save around $3,000 a month, and I invest about $2,000 of that into stocks, crypto, and other things.

The comp structure for my current job would have me making around $60,000 by next July as well. I know with this new position I would eventually move to an AE role and be making 6 figures. I have no doubt in my ability to perform its more of a cost opportunity analysis.

My schedule currently consists of me leaving the house M-F at around 6:50 am to make it to work on time, and I leave the office at 5, get home at 6, and from there will do all my school work and go to the gym.

It's worth nothing, I’m attending community college online, which costs me nothing. In fact, I actually get paid to go to school through FAFSA.

The situation I’m trying to figure out is that I recently got a job offer from a large tech company for an inbound SDR role with a $70k OTE. It sounds like a solid step up career-wise, but the catch is that I’d have to move to Boston. While it’s a $23k pay bump, moving out on my own would skyrocket my expenses, and my lifestyle would change drastically. I'm not against this idea at all, I haven't crunched the numbers yet, but if my savings remain the same, it seems like a great idea. I would also be on my own which is a nice idea in some ways.

Also helpful to note, I would be able to work remotely on Fridays, which is a nice bonus as currently I'm in office all week.

I’m just trying to weigh my options here. I know it’s a pretty unique scenario, so any thoughts or advice would be super helpful. I figure worst case scenario I'm alone in Boston and broke, best case scenario I jump on a great opportunity and set myself up for the future.

I only make around $300-$600 a month with my side hustles. I’m not sure if I should keep saving up but it’s getting hard because most of my money goes to monthly payments which leaves me with nothing. I was planning to get a secret job without my parents and family knowing at Starbucks since they have flexible shifts. I’m just worried about them finding out.

So, I am planning to get a secret job and try to save as much money as possible even if I get caught.

Could I get any advice on what I should do? I made an outline on the bottom.

**Credit Card 1:** $1,000.00 (25% APR)

personalfinance,Roth vs Traditional contributions,"
To simplify this we are going to assume that the tax brackets and the standard deduction when I retire are the same as today. We are also going to ignore inflation for now.

Am I correct that a $40,200 traditional withdrawal only creates a federal tax bill of $1,100?

I’m getting this figure factoring in a married standard deduction of $29,200 and a 10% tax rate on $11,000 (or less) of income

An additional (approximately) 33k of trad withdrawals are only taxed at 12%

At one point I assumed Roth was better over a long time period because there could be tons of gains all tax free. I recently realized (if above assumptions are correct) that having 1 million in trad money at a 4% withdrawal rate is almost tax free as well on top of more deductions now. 

My current thought is to aim for Roth and trad funds to be relatively equal. If I was retiring today I would be comfortable with 2.5mil retirement portfolio on top of a paid off home. So 1.25 Roth and 1.25 trad for a total of 100k withdrawal with a pretty small tax bill.

How do you fine people balance your Roth vs trad contributions to take advantage of the cheap tax rate on lower income amounts?

Am I thinking about all this correctly?

personalfinance,Medical Crisis + Small Business Setback = $17K Debt due 12/3—Need Ideas to Dig Out,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice or ideas to help me get back on track after a tough year. I’m a 41-year-old single guy with a solid $100K job, and it’s just me and my dog at home. Over the last couple of years, life threw a lot at me: I paid for multiple funerals during COVID, which drained my savings, but I stayed afloat.

In 2023, I felt ready to start a small business. I took a risk and put $20K on a 0% APR credit card to cover startup costs. Things were moving along—until early this year when I was in a near fatal accident and suffered a brain injury spending almost 4 months in the hospital, learning to walk and talk again. I couldn’t work or cook, so I had to rely on DoorDash for months, spending nearly $2K on food/mo. Now the promotional period for the credit card is ending on December 3rd, and interest (25%) will kick in on the $17K I still owe.  Sadly, without the hospital bills and expenses related, I could have paid off the $20K without launching the side biz.  But the two combined have crushed me.  

I was told I might qualify for a hardship extension from my credit card company and so had been breathing easy for months not stressing thinking I'd have time and patience to get this paid, but I found out there’s no help coming yesterday...panic mode induced. I also had two other cards for groceries and living expenses but while in the hospital (about 4 months) they weren't paid and jacked up interest and crushed credit.  My credit dropped from 740 to 610 due to interest piling up. Yesterday I applied for balance transfers and personal loans—denied for a balance transfer, but I was approved for an $8K loan at 28% APR, which helps, but not nearly enough. (I did not accept, just mentioning I looked into this)

**What am I doing right now to fix......**

* put myself on an extreme spending freeze for only necessities
* starting a meal prep service for apartment complex this weekend (290 units, 1,000+ people) to see if that brings in any extra cash.  I'll offer to cook meals cheaper than any other meal prep service and hand deliver to anyone taking custom orders
* will sell my clothes on poshmark (whatever I can, leaving myself a few things I like)
* will sell what I can on offer up/FB market (bye bye laptop)

 I’ll also work hard over the next few months and can probably pay down another $3-4K. I’m I’m really hustling, but I’m still facing a big debt by December 3rd when the interest hits. The compounding interest will CRUSH me. 

Does anyone have any advice on options I may not be thinking of? Or maybe you’ve been through something similar and found a way out? I’m willing to work hard, and I won’t give up, but I’m not sure what the best move is from here. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!",1728085056.0,1,3,1fwd3gq

personalfinance,401k loan to payoff credit card debt  ,"I know this topic has been well covered after going through the history of this sub, but I think I may have one of the few exceptions where using a 401k loan may be worth it. 

Background: 
27 years old. Salary is $130,000. HCOL area. 
I own 3 rental properties for a total of 6 units that gross about $1,000- $1,200 in cash flow a month in which I have invested a net total of $65,000 in cash into. I bought these in 2022,2023,2024 and have 30 year fixed rate debt on all, 6/6 unit rented with paying tenants. 

The last property went about $50k over budget. I did not have the capital to cover this so I went into about $30k in credit card debt to get the 3 units rented. I have 27k in a 401k. I have $3-5k in each property account as an ""emergency fund"" and operating account. I have about $3-5k in checking account. I am essentially living ""paycheck to paycheck"" in the sense that I have a large chunk of debt and years to pay off. 

My argument FOR using the 401k loan to pay off a large chunk is this: 
I always viewed these properties as my retirement account (as a bonus to a 401k), and in that sense, using my 401k for an immediate need seems like a reasonable use of that money. If I retire in 30 years after paying my mortgage every month, no cash flow, no appreciation, I'd have around $1MM in property sale, and thus can ""fund"" my retirement.

personalfinance,Maximizing health insurance coverage across incongruent open enrollment periods,"My spouse and I are considering a switch from my health insurance to his in order to maximize coverage for infertility treatments, and doing planning in advance of this year's open enrollment period.   
  
We are likely to max out coverage on my plan this year and if so, are considering a switch to his to essentially reset our coverage. I'm looking for advice given our incongruent open enrollment periods.  
  
-My Open Enrollment: November 2024 for benefit period 1/1-12/31 2025  
-Spouse's Open Enrollment: February 2025 for benefit period 4/1/25-3/31/2026  
(We are not recently married, etc so no basic QLEs apply)  
  
In a worst case scenario, I could keep my coverage for next year, purchase an exchange policy effective January 1, and then cancel it and join my husband's policy in April. This would ensure no period without fertility coverage, but it would mean possibly paying two out of pocket maxes (which are still cheaper than paying out of pocket if we are still receiving treatment.) That said, I am wondering if there is a better way, or something I am missing.

A few items I have tossed around:

-Would declining coverage under my employer during open enrollment (OE Nov 2024; coverage effective Jan 1 2025) constitute a QLE and allow me to join my husband's plan effective Jan 1 2025?  
-Is my husband's open enrollment a QLE for me if I opt in to my plan for 2025? (I think not.)  
-I \*do also\* have the option to purchase an independent policy during open enrollment which would provide fertility coverage, and then drop it once I have used what I need, but this is more expensive than my husband's plan would be  
-A tiny caveat is that I won't know the exact plan being offered by my husband's employer until February. (We live in a US state that mandates coverage for fertility treatment, but his employer is \*technically\* religiously-affiliated, meaning they do have the right to opt out. This would be highly unlikely, but if they were to cease offering the same/similar plan, how would that, if at all, impact the situation.)

I'm not so worried about a few hunded or thousand dollars here or there, just trying to think through how to maximize coverage/minimize cost while avoiding periods without fertility coverage, which would necessitate having to pay 100% out of pocket in any interim period.

I am currently a little over $400 overdue as of today (my mom, god bless her, made a $500 payment towards my balance yesterday, bringing it to the nearly $400 now). My payments are due around the 16th of every month. My car, currently, is not running. it is unfortunate, but I do not know exactly what is wrong with it. The car was having an issue, and when a shop looked at it, while it was still running, they said, worst case scenario it might need a new engine, but best case scenario I might need a new head gasket. About two weeks after the shop looked at it, the car stopped running. I do not have the funds unfortunately to get it looked at and get a diagnosis for exactly what is wrong with it at this point. Which means I have a $6300 paperweight essentially. Looking at mine and my partners budget, chances are we will continue to be underwater with this for another six months at least. The car is currently not at risk of repossession, until I end up being 80 calendar days late on a payment. I was 78 days late til my mom helped make a payment towards the balance, and have been brought down to I believe 43 days late as of today.

So, I would like to have another vehicle, however, both me and my partner have discussed just getting onto Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, and finding a cheap running vehicle, hopefully around $2000 for us to try to save up for, however, it’s hard to save up any money with our financial situation currently, especially with my current car needing to have payments made towards it. 

What are my options for getting a running car, and being able to lessen my debt? Is it worth it to try trade the vehicle in for a lower valued vehicle at the same dealership I got it at, or another local dealership?

personalfinance,How do Principal payments affect an Amortization Schedule?,"Hello!  

I just closed on a house, am moving in, etc etc.  I realize that interest is front-loaded into a home loan, and I am curious how to most effectively spend my money, and how principal payments affect my mortgage.

A few informational notes to inform on cashflow:

* I already do and will continue maxing my Roth IRA annually.

* I already do and will continue to max my 401k annually.

* I did not liquidate any stocks or mutual funds to fund a cash purchase of my house because I consider those essentially ""income"" - assuming 7% annual return, mortgage interest of sub-7%, it made sense.

I understand that my mortgage payment for years to come is going to be 95% interest and 5% principal.  I hate that.  I BELIEVE that beyond funding my Roth IRA and 401k, I should focus excess income into principal payments.   

What does that do?  Does it reduce the number of payments from 30 years to less?  My mortgage is ~$400k.  I theoretically understand that a principal payment of $10k means interest can only be calculated against $390k remaining balance, but I don't know how that works, or what impact it has.

Am I right in assuming that reducing mortgage principal is more important than investing in my (honestly 11% - 18%) mutual funds?  

I don't like debt, I want to be out of it ASAP - my friends convinced me to mortgage instead of liquidating assets to buy - so I want to go about this intelligently, but this isn't my field of expertise.",1728078604.0,1,6,1fwatui
personalfinance,Difference between 2 individual HSAs and 1 “family” HSA (no kids),"I’m having trouble understanding the practical difference between my spouse and I (both covered by the same HDHP) having 2 separate HSAs versus one HSA (under my SSN) with a “family” contribution limit.

(Note that I currently use my individual HSA as an investment account, not for healthcare costs. We’d be doing the same regardless of which account strategy we choose.)

As far as I can tell, the overall annual contribution limit is the same. So, the only differences I can manage to find are:
1. Legal separation of accounts if there’s a divorce can make things a little cleaner (maybe, maybe not)
2. If there’s an age gap, then catch-up contributions from the older spouse cannot be made if it’s one HSA under the younger spouse’s SSN

I currently make $91,424/yr base and a yearly bonus that can vary - did not include bonus in calculation. And can rely on a minimum of 3% CoL increase/yr. 

Current Roth 401K contribution is 5%, company matching 100% of first 4%. I do plan to increase this once we get out of some minor debt that is currently interest free and already planned in budget to be paid off by April 2026. Also plan to open and max out Roth IRA starting May 2026.

We get paid bi-weekly, so 26 payments per year. Current contribution per paycheck with company matching is $316.71 (with a 3% every year).

My 401k balance is $68,377.56. 

At an estimated 5% growth/yr, I am showing that in 31yrs I’ll have a total of $1.185M. 

Am I leaving out fees? How do I calculate the percentage? My 401k is through Empower. My Q2 beg. balance was $58,880.37, end $63,243.47 and I had $45.84 in fees. 

I have also tried to calculate an estimate of the balance with withdrawals through age 95. Since my wife and I do not have children, I assumed a 6% draw rate and continued growth at a rate of 5%. 

I’m showing that I will be able to withdraw $5,928.18/mth ($71,138.22/yr) and would still have ~$347k balance at 95yo. 

Did I make the correct calculations and assumptions? Should I lower expectations on 5% annual growth? 

For the Roth IRA, I show that I’d be able to withdrawal an additional $2,434.70/mth in retirement - if I started contributing $260 beginning on my next paycheck (6 remaining after today) and using same growth and withdrawal assumptions.

personalfinance,Am I dumb for thinking this is a good idea?,"Long Story short - I purchased a house behind my parents house at an incredible value and interest rate in 2021. 385k purchase price, put 40k down, 2.75% interest rate. Mortgage plus taxes comes to around 2k a month. The house was appraised at 530k, and since I have done extensive renovations to it with some help from my parents. Similar houses in my neighborhood and areas nearby are selling anywhere between 600 and 800k. I also have a no interest 7 year loan for a new heating system in my house that costs about 3k a year. I rent out one of my bedrooms to a good friend of mine for $600 a month plus half utilities (from what I understand far below market value for rent in my area).

I know this isn’t a forever situation. I’m always thinking about ways to make the best out of good circumstances. My parents are nearing retirement and are looking to sell their home soon. Their house has an additional floor and will likely sell between 850 and 1.1 (similar to houses around us with similar features currently selling for).

I’m in a relationship with someone whom live in the first floor of her parents two family. They are very gracious and helpful with her and only charge her $500 a month. She’s mentioned this same price would be offered to me if I moved in with her. This is a significant saving on my monthly expenses even if you count the rent I currently take in.

I had this thought of what seems like a mutual business decision I could make with my parents. They sell their house, move into my house and pay off the remaining mortgage (around 300k) and in return the house is theirs until they pass away. I’d keep the house in my name but would sign any document that prevents me from doing anything with the house until they both pass.

Pro for them: the get a house that fits their needs for much cheaper than they would ever get otherwise (the want to have a home near why they currently live, they just want to downsize) and they keep a much larger portion on the sale of their home. Pro for me, I have a paid off house that I can use or sell after my parents are done with it (and I genuinely hope that won’t happen for a long time!) plus I lower my expenses monthly living with my partner.

I know the inherent risks (I break up with my partner etc….) but am I missing anything about my idea in terms of letting my parents live in my house and in return they pay off the mortgage? It sounds good in my head but I feel like I’m missing something painfully obvious.

personalfinance,Should I be using a backdoor Roth IRA conversion? Any caveats?,"Here's my current situation:

* I have a relatively high salary - above the threshold where I can contribute to a Roth IRA.
* I have been contributing to a traditional IRA for a few years, but all the contributions were nondeductible because I also contribute to a 401K.
* The current value of the IRA is about $32,000, of which about $25,000 was contributed and $7,000 is growth.

I had heard about backdoor conversions years go, but only recently came to understand why they were useful and that I was probably in the position to use it. 

Question 1: Am I correct that my position (unable to contribute directly to a Roth IRA, and unable to contribute pre-tax money to a traditional IRA due to 401K contributions) indicates I should be doing Roth conversions on my IRA contributions?

If yes:

From what I've read, it's generally advisable to do Roth conversions immediately after contributing, because even if the money was contributed post-tax there's a tax penalty on the account growth, so it's best to convert before the money has had time to grow. There's also a tax penalty based on the proportion of money that was invested pre-tax, but I haven't done this, so I don't think that should apply?

Question 2: If I were to convert my current IRA to a Roth, what would be the tax implication? Is it just the equivalent of, say, capital gains on the $7,000 of growth? Or is there more to consider?

Question 3: Would these taxes realistically change how I should go about doing this? Or should I just do the conversion and eat the taxes on the $7,000?",1728072925.0,2,3,1fw8oaq

personalfinance,Maxing out retirement. Putting extra cash in a brokerage account. Am I thinking about this the right way?,"Hello all, 

Between this group and r/Bogleheads, I've made the decision, based on lots of your tips, to take our extra uninvested cash and put it into a non-tax advantaged brokerage account. 

I won't give too much context because the context was already discussed in prior conversations, but we have \~170K in uninvested cash and we are now maxing our our 401Ks and Roth IRAs. (The cash is in an HYSA earning about 4.2%)

After our emergency fund (8 months of 2 people out of work), we have 97K. I'm still hesitant to throw it all in a brokerage, based on what I think we need now versus 5 years from now. 

What I have done is broken down the 97K into 

1. Anticipated 2025 expenses and reserves (car maintenance, anticipated taxes owed, family oop max, etc), call it a pre-emergency fund. **$31,000**
2. Planned expenses not needed for at least 3-5 years (50% of this account balance for a second home and 5% for a new car until 20K) **$54,000**
3. Unallocated funds (the difference) **$12,000**

My plan is to take #2 and #3 **$66,000** of the $97K and put into a brokerage. 

My question is basically sense checking this; would you invest the whole 97K or would you look at your balance in this way, allocating short-term costs and keeping them in the HYSA while moving everything else to brokerage? 

Before educating myself on finance, I started out as someone skeptical of 401Ks, investments, etc. And this is very hard earned money and I'm nervous about moving it, but I know I will lose it to inflation if I don't do something with it.

But also don't want to lose out on this job. I read that statue of limitations is 3 years for NYS, but if I dispute the charge how likely will it get removed from my report(at 5 years) and how quickly?

Update: I appreciate the advise and have disputed it. Surprisingly it was only on two of three bureaus and one of them I froze a while back due to an identify theft scare. The job offered to extend my potential start date to the end of the month while I try to get this resolved, which was nice but I'm doubtful it'll be solved in time so I'll start the job hunt again in case. I wonder if anyone has had any success with disputing and removal prior to 7 year mark for a debt collection but passed the states statue of limitations. The job I was offered is in a financial institution so I understand their concern and the reason for the check.

I just got a 131k job offer out of college, with 30k sign-on bonus.

The job is in NoVA (but I can commute from cheaper areas or even my current home\*\*).

I don't have a car. I don't have any loans. I live with my parents\*\*, but I want to get out asap, as I am 27 and single.

I would really appreciate some fine-tuned digestible advice.

I could try to become a financial expert, so you could recommend some digestible resources, but I don't know anything right now.

Hopefully you can fine-tune the advice based on these ideas of mine:

1. ""I want to spend."" Yes, I've been broke my whole life, and I would like to ""spend"" now. Lots of going out. Convenient and nutrition packed food options that may be expensive. Spending on clothes (little purchases). Spending on vacations (big purchases). Getting a jet ski, or two cheap cars to race around a track and beat up. I would also like to give gifts to my family and cover my friend's tabs on occasion, so I know I will have to make choices on spending/budgeting; I don't want to wait till I'm 40 to ""retire early"" and have nice stuff as the result of putting all my money into this and that, and driving a cheap car.
2. I think the money's just going to keep coming in and growing. Software careers/salaries exhibit a trend of growing over time. So while I'm not rich, and I can't get everything at once, I think my income will grow and I could use some advice like ""get a high yield savings account, budget 10/10/20/30/30 on car/home/little spending/big spending/saving.... do/dont maximize your 401k contributions that your company matches... get a 6 month rainy day fund in your savings account... ROTH IRA?""

Idk. I don't know much about finances. But I have looked at my 6-month expenses report, living at home, once, and it was shocking. I'm also very capable of becoming very financially literate and then sharing the knowledge with my friends and family, so I hope you can help! And last but not least, please try to tune the advice to consider that I really do just want to go out and spend money and have fun.

Thank you in advance.

investing,HYSA's paying more interest than government debt?,"My wife and I have recently started looking at interest-bearing accounts for emergency funds and planned expenses. Most savings accounts and money market funds I see are paying slightly under T-bill rates. This makes sense to me, since these products offer more liquidity and less hassle than laddering T-bills.

However, I've also seen a few savings accounts on Bankrate that are currently paying more interest than any government debt, and still come with the same liquidity. LendingClub offers one, as well as Poppy Bank and Western Alliance. This doesn't make sense to me, basically because I can't tell what the catch is. At first, I thought Lending Club's account made sense, since they're focused on personal loans with higher interest rates than government debt. Most banks make money this way, though, so there really shouldn't be a difference.

I'm also wondering if these are introductory rates, which will drop as soon as they have enough people signed up. I've been monitoring HYSA's for a while now, but I've never had any confidence in them because there always seems to be a different one at the top of the list every time I look.

investing,Invest and Retirement Advice for 25YO,"
Hi all, long time reader, first time poster.
So I’m 25, I make about 120-130k USD a year (depending on company offered RSU price.)

I was struggling financially previously, overspent and was in heavy debt (50k+ consumer debt) in my late teens and early twenties. As of now I have paid off all my debt, my 401k is back on, and I have a little savings. My fiancée and I live together, she brings in about 90k USD a year, getting married in February. Overall we’re looking pretty good financially and I wouldn’t say we live above our means. Im extremely grateful as I didn’t decide to go to school and never for a second would’ve thought I’d be where I am income wise.

I’m here to ask about investments and retirements. I want to ensure we are financially set to retire by 65, if not even a little earlier while also still being able to have fun, take vacations, and just enjoy life young (within reason obviously.)

Right now, my 401k takes 4% of my pay (but this is base as around 35% of my overall pay is in RSUs) with a 2% company match. That’s the highest my company will match and I am not against raising it but we still do have bills to pay. 401k has around 10k in it. I do not currently have a ROTH IRA.

I have 10k sitting in an HYSA that’s been there the last few months after paying all of the debt off. 

I am also interested in starting my own business or getting into real estate at some point but financially it doesn’t seem feasible with the lack of capital rig but now.

So biggest question is: what would you advise I do? Should I increase contributions to 401k? Move that 10k into investments somewhere? This is all fairly foreign to me growing up in the lower class bubble and watching my parents live paycheck to paycheck.

investing,rate of return calculation- is this legit ?,"to me it appears to be overstating returns?

  
We use the daily time-weighted return method to find your rate of return. This method calculates daily value changes, then adjusts for the timing and size of any contributions and withdrawals you made,

Example Alex's portfolio is valued at $10,000 on January 1. By July 1, the account value has risen to $12,500. Alex then invests $5,000 on July 1, resulting in a new value of $17,500. By the end of the year, the account value has risen again to $20,000. How would we calculate Alex's rate of return from January 1 to December 31, considering the contribution made on July 1?

Step 1: Divide the overall time period into sub-periods based on times where Alex contributed or withdrew money.

* Jan 1–Jul 1: Sub-period #1
* Jul 1–Dec 31: Sub-period #2

Step 2: Find the rate of return for each sub-period using this calculation:((Ending value – net contributions) / beginning value) – 1 = sub-period return

* Sub-period #1: (12,500 / 10,000) – 1 = 25.0%
* Sub-period #2: (20,000 / 17,500) – 1= 14.3%

Step 3: Combine the returns using this calculation:

(1 + sub-period #1 return) × (1 + sub-period #2 return) – 1

* (1 + 0.250) x (1 + 0.143) – 1 = 42.9%

Alex's daily time-weighted return from Jan 1 to Dec 31: 42.9%Cumulative and annualized returnsIn our example, we looked for the rate of return for an portfolio for one year. The value we found is called a cumulative return.For time periods longer than a year, we can look for an annualized return. 

An annualized return is the average rate of return each year. This can be helpful when comparing your performance to market indexes, whose returns are always annualized.

**Founded in 2021, the Texas Hydrogen Alliance is a 501(c)(6) non-profit trade organization that brings together policymakers, regulators, industry leaders and innovators to advocate for policies that expedite hydrogen adoption, promote low-carbon hydrogen production, and develop robust infrastructure for storage and distribution. The Alliance seeks not only to strengthen Texas' position as the energy capital of the world, but also to create new opportunities for economic growth and innovation in the hydrogen sector.**

The problem with $PLUG,  $FCEL, $TECO is that they have enormous operations and are (mostly) riddled with debt, diluted their shares.

The innovative solar hydrogen panels SunHydrogen is developing use abundant and low-cost materials, require no external power other than sunlight, and are designed with scalability in mind. The Company intends to install its green hydrogen panel arrays at and near roadside refueling sites along major trucking routes with abundant land and sun, lowering the high costs and hydrogen losses associated with typical long-distance transport.

In January 2024, Texas received a $70 million grant from the Federal Highway Administration supporting the creation of a hydrogen trucking corridor for medium and heavy-duty trucks. The funding will go toward the construction of up to five stations across Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio, with the eventual goal of building a corridor between Texas and Southern California.

Additionally, Texas is the site of the HyVelocity Hydrogen Hub, one of seven regional clean hydrogen hubs selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive up to $1.2 billion in funding. HyVelocity Hub participants Air Liquide, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Sempra Infrastructure are also part of the Texas Hydrogen Alliance

investing,What some network effect business you invest?,"“The network effect is a business principle that illustrates the idea that when more people use a product or service, its value increases.”

The Network Effect Defined

The network effect is a business principle that illustrates the idea that when more people use a product or service, its value increases. The network effect significantly applies to digital platforms, dating all the way back to the internet itself. When the internet became more widely used, more people relied on it to conduct work, deepen personal connections, and for research and other functions.

Example: social network platforms

The network effect is especially prominent on online platforms that encourage users to add other users to the platform’s network. Social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are key examples of the network effect. The more people that use the platform in an individual’s network, the more likely it is that individual will use the platform, too.

Example: E-commerce platforms 

E-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, also benefit from the network effect. As more retailers opt to sell their goods on Amazon, the more consumers will look to Amazon to shop. The reverse is also true.

We have $50k saved in a HYSA, and are considering purchasing my mother a condo or small home in a 55+ community for ~200k. We'd be able to put $100k down for the down payment by the time we hope to purchase in 1.5 years.

We are maxing both our retirement accounts and IRA's. We feel like we are in a good place financially, and would like to give back to my mother who put me through college. My father is disabled and a ward of the state in government housing, and we expect no expenses for him moving forward since those are covered. My in-laws are also in good financial shape with an owned home.

My siblings are not in a financial position to support her expect perhaps with food and other minor expenses when she retires.

My question is: is this a terrible idea? We would be doing it under the understanding that she may never contribute a dime in rent or other expenses, and we would be prepared to fully carry the burden. If she contributes a bit, that's great.

That said, it's a lot of money to lock down, and if we ever wanted to buy a home of our own, would have to move her somewhere else to sell it and use that capital.

Appreciate any folks thoughts, potential pitfalls to this, or other strategies we might consider pursuing.",1728065768.0,72,97,1fw5wno

personalfinance,28 y/o balancing saving for a house while paying off debts - looking for any glaring flaws for optimizing my plan,"Hey everyone,

Up until now, my savings plan has basically been nothing more than putting funds in an account that isn't my checking. For longer than I care to admit, this was my local bank's .5% APY savings account, but I have recently started to spread that out. Along with this, I've finally got a pretty reasonable goal of wanting to purchase a house or condo in the next couple of years. My current setup is:

* Income: ~$4000 / mo
* Retirement: 5% pretax to 401k, 2% posttax to Roth 401k, $50/mo to a Roth IRA
* Investments: $5,600 in a very boglehead spread. Primarily index funds, with maybe $1000 in stocks to play around with.
* Savings: $14,000 in a HYSA @ 4.5% / $4,200 in a MMF
* Expenses / Debts: $950/mo rent. ~$500/mo for other expenses. Pay my credit card balance off in full every month. $11,039 car principal @ 4.61% ($372/mo minimum payment), $3,085 student loan principal @ 2.75% ($52/mo minimum payment), ~$350/mo for medical financing plans @ 0% interest.

Looking at all this, I'm realizing now I'm getting a bit overwhelmed realizing where it would be most optimal to put my money away / what I should prioritize paying off. I've mostly been just throwing it into the HYSA as a house fund, as that is my main goal now, but am unsure how much I should be putting in the market. I've heard that any capital in the market is something that you should be comfortable not having available for about 2 years due to market volatility. 

Additionally, while crunching the numbers, it flashed in my mind that I actually could pay my car off fully if I wanted to. It's a perfectly serviceable 2017 Honda that I plan to drive until it dies. My napkin math says that this isn't a very good idea though, as even with the .11% difference of my car payments APR and my HYSA, the HYSA already has a larger amount in it, and will continually grow as the car payment proceeds to shrink. I applied the same kind of logic to my student loan. With these interest rates, is it a reasonable plan to continue making the minimum payments here, with the HYSA / MMF returns offsetting any interest paid towards the loans?

I'm curious to hear others opinions about my current situation and plan moving forward. I didn't get much financial guidance from my parents when I was younger, so I'm doing a lot of this by the seat of my pants. For context, I'm also saving up for the house with my soon-to-be fiance. While I don't feel it's my right to share her financial info, it's reasonable to say we're in a pretty similar spot as individuals. She covers the utilities and our phone bills. If the worst were to occur, I'd estimate that it would probably be about an extra $500/mo for me to cover. Any feedback is greatly appreciated, and I'd be happy to provide more information if it might contextualize some things further. Thank you!",1728056949.0,3,6,1fw2erp

Would there be any difference if I contributed the above total monthly contribution all into the Roth 401(a) which would meet the IRS limit by August each year? After August the retirement contributions would automatically transferred to the post-tax 401(a).  Supposedly I would still be receiving the company match in these later months, despite having gone over the $23,000 IRS limit.  

[This article](https://insights.wjohnsonassociates.com/blog/income-limits-for-contributing-to-a-401k#:~:text=The%20IRS%20specifies%20that%20only,an%20employee%20reaches%20that%20threshold) about high earner contributions made me question the latter strategy. 

Does it really matter which way it is done for tax purposes when withdrawing in retirement? Would appreciate any insight.

personalfinance,Parent died and hasn't filed taxes in over 12 years.,"Without getting too complicated, the title is my quandry.

      My Dad died suddenly of ALS last year, I was already pretty well versed in elder care because my Mom had a stroke, but it was ALL I could do to get Financial and HCPOA's in place. He was hospitalized quickly and so often we never got TOD titles for his vehicles (4- total, a bus, 2 vans and car hauler) value of MAYBE $15k) or beneficiaries on his accounts (2- under $5k total) because as POA these two actions are considered self-serving.

He lived on his own terms. He started an LLC and made my sister sign at 18. By then I was 19 and understood enough not to sign but I am listed as a member because he filed it anyway. I learned from a Medicaid attorney the LLC is defunct due to never having income. He hasn't filed taxes since 2012, at least. *Forgot to add, this detail matters because 3/4 vehicles are listed as owned by this LLC*

My sister and I never expected to get anything from him but he gave me $6k cash he had stuffed away to build a shed on my property since he was a hoarder and I filled my 2 car garage literally to the eaves emptying his apartment and 2 friends garages of his belongings.

I don't think I have any options but I am putting this out in hopes someone has been in a similar position. Two attorney's have declined helping me file a Petition for admin of a Small Estate.

If I file for Probate of Estate, I become Executor and for at least $1k out of my pocket I gain the work of trying to piece together my Dad's work history over at least 10 years (uber, door dash, over table, under table, 1099's). Honestly, we would still end up with nothing due to having to pay residual medical bills and it would be basically a year of full-time work with no pay. Not an option as I NEED to return to actual, paying work.

I know I *could* file the Small Estate petition myself, God Knows I figured out enough myself in the Medical, Legal and Financial fields over the last few decades. But it is still unclear if my state (Ohio) will require me to file taxes (I have called 3 attorney's and 2 counties probate offices).

I have a sister but she is Autistic, HoH and disliked our dad enough that she was barely present for his care. 

My dillemas in walking away are:
1) My sister has and always will struggle due to her disabilities and whenever I discuss walking away, she reminds me she has credit card debt.

2) I know walking away from the vehicles creates a burden on the storage place for the vehicles, I made sure they are paid through Jan 25 but after that. They will have 4 abandoned vehicles (2 filled with junk) to deal with.

personalfinance,401k: Should I rebalance less aggressive and historically less yielding funds when markets are at all-time high? Please guide 🙏 ,"Hello,
 Need advice on rebalancing 401K portfolio because the mutual funds have been consistently underperforming and robo-advisor (merrill) made some allocation years ago that led to such underperformance. To make matters worse, some funds have high expense ratio (0.4-0.7%).
 There were certainly some lessons learnt along the way but would love suggestions from folks here.

Action: Reallocate funds from bonds, capital preservation and underperforming US equity active to ➡️ US Equity index

Reason: Less aggressive (bonds or capital preservation), significantly underperforming US equity active fund when compared to benchmark Russell3000 and relative high expense ratios.

1) Should I dollar cost average or go lump sum to rebalance my portfolio? 
2) Should I not wait anymore and start with smaller DCA's and in case if the market drops, reallocate bigger chunks?
  -- Per my limited knowledge, it feels like a double whammy to reallocate funds that historically have not reaped market equivalent yields (partially due to my ignorance because I'd have been more aggressive) and are now being used to buy index ETFs at all-time highs.

Capital preservation: 3%
Bond: 10%

personalfinance,Confused on how an HSA works,"I was taking to my friend last night and now I think I fundamentally misunderstand how a HSA works. From what I understood, you put money into it, that money isn't taxed. You're allowed to contribute up to an annual cap. You can only contribute if you are on a high deductible health insurance plan. You can invest the money inside, and any growth it has is also not taxed. Finally, you can use the funds to pay for qualifying medical expenses or to later reimburse yourself for one paid out of pocket, which is also not taxed. While chatting, he mentioned things about rollover limits and only contributing my estimated medical expenses. I almost never have any medical expenses, so I was under the impression it was basically a tax advantaged investment account. How much should I really be looking to put into my HSA?

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice! Turns out he was talking about a FSA and there was just some confusion. I appreciate the help!",1728042907.0,100,68,1fvxbp5

personalfinance,Options for the very risk averse,"Hi Reddit! My 66 year old mother has inherited about $2.5M. This has been sitting in a combination of CDs and money markets for the last year as the estate was finalized. She is asking me for help managing her finances going forward, as she is incredibly overwhelmed. I am fairly competent at personal finance and manage my own (much smaller) retirement portfolio. However, at 37, I have a very different time horizon and risk profile.

She has stated that her main goal for this money is to grow it for me to inherit one day. She is largely supported day to day by her husband (they keep finances separate), and has no major expenses. I'm encouraging her to make some home renovations and travel more, but she's not a fancy person and not much of a shopper, so she is not going to blow through this money. 

  
All this said, she is incredibly risk averse. I've explained to her that the best way to achieve her stated goal is to invest the vast majority of it, but in these conversations I've come to understand that she is not willing to take losses. In addition to being scared of the stock market, she is constantly bringing up the risk of financial institution failure and FDIC limits. She is also extremely politically motivated, so depending on who wins the election, I fear she is going to completely shut down.  

I've spoken to a few financial professionals about what might be available to her. I'm considering a 5 year fixed annuity for some of it (Athene MYG), since I can at least lock in close to 5% for a few years while I'm expecting rates on CDs to start going down quickly.  Everything else they pitched me, such as index linked annuities with downside protection, seemed way too convoluted. 

Any advice for me? Am I missing any options, or are we stuck with CDs and simple annuities? I'm going to continue to work on her letting me start with a small portion to invest the way I would my own money. I hope she will become more comfortable over time, but she may not.

personalfinance,How much can we realistically afford?,"My wife and I have a fairly complex financial background, and I would love some advice with our current decision.

For background - I make a base salary currently of 135,000 with an all but guaranteed minimum bonus of 12.5% and a max bonus of 25% based on performance metrics. Since starting at the company I currently work for, my last three have hovered pretty much right at the 20-21% mark (we have all discussed how it might be impossible to actually max it out). Additionally, our company communicates raises this month and the new salaries go into effect November 1. My goal is to negotiate for $160 base. (This is also not unrealistic, as since I have started here my annual raises have consistently been between $16,000-20,000). Further, it is highly likely that this level of raise (% wise) should continue annually until around the $300k level at which point equity and other forms of compensation would kick in. 

We both just turned 28 and have approximately $60k in 401k. My wife was a teacher previously, but we just had our first baby so she no longer works. 

In addition to my W2 earnings, my parents and grandparents use the gift tax exclusion limit to gift all children/grandchildren between $20-50k annually. This is all 100% tax free - and started around 4 years ago. 

As can probably be deciphered from the above, my family has a decent net worth in both highly liquid investments, and an even greater net worth tied up in 3rd generation family businesses. We truly understand the tremendous safety net and privilege we have; however, we have never in our life had to lean on it and our goal is to never get to a point where we rely on that safety net or have to ask for any handouts. That being said, we still plan our lives as if none of that exists. We recently started maxing out my 401k and also receive a 5% match, and after our current mortgage, car payment, and fixed bills - we have around $2,500 in disposable income each month at my current salary.

Now my questions: we are currently moving cities and looking at homes. Moving from a LCOL area to a MCOL area. Our only current debt is a vehicle at 739 a month with around $30k left on it. It is only a 6% rate, so not a terribly high interest rate. However question 1 is should we pay this off? We have approximately $150k that we can use for a down payment. This $150k would be what the car payoff would come from. 

Based on the 25% of take home pay rule, we would be right around $1,500 on my current base salary. That quite literally does not exist in today’s economy. Using the 28% rule, we’re looking at more like $3,150. So question 2 is: with all factors considered, what level of mortgage would you be comfortable with?


TLDR: Complex financial situation. Current base pay of $135,000. Wife is staying at home with current baby + future kids. Pushing for $160k base at next raise on November 1 and career likely to continue with stable annual progression of approximately $15-20k raises and stabilize around $300k.

investing,"28, Saved $40k in My HSA, Now Expecting a Baby—How Should I Rethink My HSA Strategy?","I’ve been maxing out my HSA at $3,500 a year ($500 employer contribution) for the last six years, and investing accordingly, so it’s up to about $40,000 now. This is of course on top of a yearly-maxed 401(k) and Roth IRA, alongside two emergency savings (parked in HYSA) sources @ 6mo income. I’ve always understood the HSA to be a triple tax-advantaged account that I could use as a sanctuary for my retirement in 30 years. I’ve paid every medical expense out of pocket, which has been &lt;$500/year because I was single and very healthy.

Now, things are changing. I’m married, and we’re planning to start a family with a baby expected (if all goes well) in late 2025.

This has me thinking about two things:

1) The need to evaluate which health plans to use, which is more of a mathematical exercise for me and my wife.

2) Where I need your help—how should I be thinking about my HSA now that I’m older and about to have more medical expenses? Whether it's for myself, my spouse, or kids, how do you factor in the HSA as your health needs increase?

I also just realized that once I leave a high deductible plan, I can’t contribute to the HSA anymore. That $40K will still grow tax-free, which is great, but I was hoping to keep contributing $4k/year until the very end.

Would love to hear from those in their late 20s/early 30s who went from being single and heavily invested in their HSA to now married and planning a family. How are you approaching health insurance choices and your HSA strategy? Any insights would be appreciated!",1727190058.0,4,16,1foem5y

I am struggling to find studies that look at the same relationship in other markets e.g. other countries, large cap/small cap, specific sectors etc. I found one study comparing Denmark/Sweden/Canada/USA but that is it.

My idea is a long term investment strategy that moves money into trackers of markets with a low CAPE compared to the historical average, and moves money out of markets with a high CAPE.

investing,Is this Mortgage Insurance a scam? IUL investment help.,"I am purchasing a home, a insurance broker reached out to me and set at closing I must have spoken to an underwriter to secure Mortgage Insurance.

He confirmed you keep the entirety of the deposits for the life of the insurance while you are paying into it. And can withdraw any amount at any time without penalty after the first year (first year % withdraw max I think I recall at 60%). Plus it obviously grows and the growth is tax deferred.  
  
This sounds too good to be true. I already invest into SPY similar ETF funds. And you are going to provide half a million in mortgage insurance for basically nothing if I die?

An, it just so happened that the 13 week T-Bill auction occurred. I just received my notice that the bill with an issue date of 9/19 had an investment/interest rate of 4.874%.

Of course, the cons are it has a much higher expense ratio of 0.87% compared to 0.03% for VOO. But given it pays more than twice the yield why couldn't this be a viable alternative to VOO?

investing,Why Does Five Factor Investing Use MCW Index Funds?,"One of the tenets of the five-factor investing model is that “higher expected growth in book equity – investment – implies a lower expected return” (this is a quote from the 2015 paper).

Why then, does every five-factor portfolio I see utilize market-cap-weighted index funds as the largest holding?

My dad also has a large gap between his other siblings so he is much closer in age so his nieces and nephews, than his brothers and sisters.

I have recently come into some money in the amount of $50,000. And , I'm looking to invest it into the market preferable in my existing ETF (VOO) to which I have been investing on a monthly basis for a while now.

The query I had was does it what is the saner approach, would it be to invest this money all at once into the ETF or divide the money over a period of say 50 months and invest over time?

Any advice would be appreciated.

investing,Invest for long-term in VUL or in low-cost index fund,"42, &gt;600k gross family income, max out 401k and Roth IRAs. No 529 as kids are only 2-6 years away from college and returns so far have been very low. I am in the highest tax bracket and will continue to be there for the next years. I am paying a s\*\*t ton of taxes and I want to reduce that.

I am looking to invest some money (100k now, can add \~100k per year), and I am debating between a low-cost index fund (VOO or similar in my e-trade account), or a Variable Universal Life Insurance for my child (I already have one + lower premiums), and use it as a tax-advantageous investment option for the future.

  
Low-cost index fund will grow or shrink with S&amp;P500, which is good for long-term growth. Dividends will be taxed as income as earned (at highest tax rate), even if reinvested. If I want to take money out, I will pay taxes on any gains, at highest tax rate. Scenarios would be paying downpayment on a house/condo for kids when they grow up...

With VUL I am thinking about getting the smallest amount of coverage (50-100k), and then invest the difference to \~50k per year. I know there are some fees involved, but the idea of tax-free gains and ability to take loans against the amounts paid without paying any taxes at that time, seems interesting.

I have almost around 200k investment in Robinhood. Last year in September 2023, I moved to Canada and am planning on returning November of this year back to the US. I am not a US citizen but I am a resident for tax purposes until my move to Canada (lived in the US for 8 years on student visa). Robinhood sent me a notice saying that I might be accessing the account from outside of the US and wanted me to verify my current address by October 1st. I tried to chat with a customer agent and they told me they have to close my account and liquidate my account OR transfer my account to another brokerage. I chose Schwab to start the transfer but I am afraid Schwab also might have restrictions about my residency. What are my options here? Should I just not respond to Robinhood and let my account freeze by not responding by Oct 1st and re-open it when i get back to the US in November? Liquidating would mean i will be in a very big tax liability as I probably have to pay tax for the entire gain I made over the years.

investing,"Declining Equity premium, possible explanation for Growth’s outperformance?","Lately I have been thinking about how index funds are impacting equity returns. 

In theory, the rise in popularity of index funds should correspond with a shrinking equity premium. As index funds become more accessible, discount rate should fall as the demand for the same quantity of future earnings increases. 

As discount rates fall, large cap growth stocks should incur greater returns because growth stocks are more sensitive to discount rate shocks (Campbell, Polk and Vuolteenaho 2009). This is to be expected under the risk based framework for factor premiums. If growth stocks are lower risk. a 1 bps decrease in discount rates in a growth stock should result in a higher price return than 1 bps decrease in value stocks, due to convexity.

We have seen index funds gain rapid popularity since the mid 1990’s in the US, and we have also seen valuations increase, and growth stocks outperforming their value counterparts.

In international markets where index investing hasn’t had as big of a stride as the US, valuations haven’t risen that significantly, and value stocks continue to outperform their growth counterparts.

Has the shift in index investing a possible explanation for Growth’s outperformance in US markets for the past 2 decades, as well as the US’s outperformance relative to international stocks? 

John Cochrane made this argument while back. Overweighting growth stocks is a solid hedge against the risk of declining discount rates. Even in a world where expected equity returns have dropped, your portfolio is hedged to benefit the most from that outcome. ",1727028688.0,0,1,1fmzlxy
investing,Home country bias in emerging markets,"Recent studies have come out that having a slight tilt towards home-country stocks (35% of your portfolio)  actually improves returns and reduces volatility - I would guess because it is a closer reflection of the inflationary cycle and currency valuation of the country the investor is living. The thing is, these studies only took into account developed ecconomies like Ireland and Canada.

  
Does that apply to people living in emerging countries, such as Brazil and Mexico? There is a lot more risk involved in the companies of these countries, and more political instability as well. Ofc, Brazil is not Russia or China, some people even coined the term 'Frontier Markets' to refer to these economies. ",1727027960.0,3,3,1fmzbkm
investing,What’s the best way to get schooled in the stock market? ,"What’s the best way to learn about this stuff so I’m not blindly buying stocks? Between my Roth, SEP, and Individual accounts, I’m doing well, don’t get me wrong, but I just buy into “common sense” stocks that I feel you can’t go wrong with like Fidelity Blue Chip Growth and S&amp;P 500, mutual funds.. I’m dumping 10-20k at a time into this stuff blindly, or atleast that was my initial contribution when I first started my individual account about a year ago. Since then I’ve just been auto-investing $250 per week into Blue Chip and S&amp;P 500, $125 and $125 each. I have other top mutual funds as well, but those are the ones that see the most contributions. On top of all that, I’ve only checked my accounts maybe 2-4 times in the last year. The auto-invest does its thing, otherwise I don’t touch or even look at it. 

I’d like to be more in-tune with this stuff and make the most of my investments, and make sure I’m getting the most out of my current investments. It took me until I was 25 to stop spending every penny I made, and it took me until 30 to realize my money can make me money instead of sitting in savings accounts not making anything. So I’m learning as I go. 

A little bit more of a background. My regular job has a really good pension and an annuity that pays $5 every hour we work, that gets invested into whatever (we don’t have control over what it gets invested in). But this past YTD alone saw a $30,000+ gain. I’m not sure how or why, but my last statement in early September said it grew from $60-some thousand to over $90,000 in the last year. Maybe I was reading it wrong, but that’s a crazy return. $30,000 divided by the $5 is only $6,000 contributed, so does that mean $24,000 of that was all gains, in the last year alone? Not to get off track, but all of that above is part of why I never looked out for myself when it came to investing, until recently, because my job offered so much that I never thought I would have to do it on my own. Back to business though, my fiancé convinced me to atleast start a Roth IRA about 5 years ago if nothing else, so I’ve been maxing that out annually since the start. Once a couple years went by and I watched it grow, that’s when it started to dawn on me. 5 years into owning my business, my accountant finally beat it into my head to start a SEP IRA, which I’ve only contributed to once. By time I get my net profit after expenses, the contribution limit is minimal and I rather just keep the money in the bank. I’ll start back on it next year as I’m finally comfortable with my equipment and everything that makes my business operate. And finally, the individual account. This is where I went wild and started dumping money into it initially, without really knowing anything. I think I saw a post on Reddit somewhere about a guy who had over a million dollars in his account, and once it hit a million he said he was making almost 100k per year from his stocks alone. So I think that lit a fire under my ass to start doing something lol. 
Aside from the weekly auto-contribution, I haven’t touched it in a year. I’d like to play around with it. I don’t really want to sell anything, I’m mainly in it for the long term, but it would be nice to get some kind of income from it annually. Which I guess is where your eyes need to be glued to the ups and downs so you buy and sell at the right times. ",1727026459.0,0,32,1fmyreb

I recognize now that I didn’t trust myself wholly or else I would have invested the cash we had sitting (approx $500) instead of the $60k. Yesterday, I bought $300k in what I would consider all time high category but I see that there are a few indicators to support this price level. However, I can’t help but to feel that I fomo’d into the stock. 

This is a mid to long term play for me. I suspect the stock is just at its infancy. Did I over react? Or should I feel more confident? It was hard to watch the swings yesterday in pricing! 

TLDR: investing life savings into a single stock in hopes of getting rich. Feel like I got in a bit too high. Time horizon is long term. ",1726927271.0,0,49,1fm3pb7

investing,When to take your profit from a stock. ,"Securing profits is always something I’ve questioned myself on. Picking the proper timing, and/or the proper stocks to pull gains from. Generally, I start thinking about it once I hit a ~20% gain on a stock. Selling just to secure gains is the only reason I’d sell. I’d reinvest that money into another stock or investment. Just wondering what others do, especially with those long-hold stocks. 





***Appreciate everyone’s feedback, and sharing some knowledge. Some really good points made. Seems like to each their own when it comes down to it. Securing the gains is my dilemma; not dissolving all my shares in the stock. Having a rule for yourself takes the guesswork out of when to sell.

investing,Need Advice on Tracking Gains and Contributions for an Informal Investment Fund with Friends,"Hi, 
I’m handling an informal investment fund with my friends where we pooled all our money into one guys brokerage account for me to trade with using LPOA. Right now, everyone contributes at random times by sending our friend money. This makes it hard to track who should get credit for gains, since contributions come in after trades have already been made, an issue I did not have the financial foresight to anticipate lol.

My current idea to fix this: Only allow contributions at the end of each month. This way, I can more easily track contributions and calculate everyone’s share of gains/losses at end of month before adding new funds then reset with new funds added into the total account value. This way, I'd basically manually track everyones total contribution value in excel. The issue is this is obviously more administratively hands on than I would prefer and I don't want my subpar math ""skills"" accidentally miscalculating someone's profit.

I’m wondering if there’s software or free apps that can automate this for me? Like a hedge fund portfolio tracker or something. Any recommendations for apps or strategies are appreciated! Or if you have done something similar to what my friends and I want to do but successfully.

For some background, I consider myself a pretty disciplined and long-term focused investor, and I am willing to accept a moderate amount of risk. I dedicate about 90% of my income (\~$2100/month) towards savings goals and investments as I have a paid off car, no debt, \~$200 bills/month, and I have a fully funded a 12 month emergency fund.

Roth IRA:

* Total Market Index (FZROX) - 70%
* International Index (FTIHX) - 23%
* US Bond Index (FXNAX) - 1%
* Bitcoin Index (FBTC) - 6%

Traditional 401(k):

* S&amp;P 500 Index (VIIIX) - 100%

Traditional IRA (rollover):

* Total Market Index (SWTSX) - 70%
* International Index (SWISX) - 30%

HSA:

* Total Market Index (FZROX) - 70%
* International Index (FTIHX) - 30%

Taxable Account(s):

* Total Market Index (VTI/SCHB) - 9.85%
* International Index (VXUS) - 6.5%
* S&amp;P 500 Index (VOO/SPLG) - 21.7%
* Nasdaq 100 Index (QQQM) - 7.15%
* Individual Equities (MSFT, AAPL, BRKB, JPM, AMZN, etc.) - 54.8%

* Traditional 401(k): 8.7%
* HSA: 2.2%
* Traditional IRA: 1.5%
* Taxable Account(s): 35.2%

1. Would it be beneficial to wait until LTCG takes effect next year and sell my individual equities in order to rebalance into my index funds or bite the bullet and just sell them off now?
2. Should I concentrate all of my bond allocation inside of my 401(k) to leave more room in my IRA for index funds? Should I have bonds at all?
3. Should I revert back to my original investment strategy within my 401(k) of the Vanguard 2070 TDF, or remain with my S&amp;P 500 Index?
4. Should I reduce my 12 month emergency fund into a 6 month emergency fund and lump-sum the difference in order to rebalance?
5. Should I just go 100% VOO in my taxable account? 50%/50% VOO/VTI? Do I need to diversify with International within this account?
6. Should I cut back on my savings/investments and focus more on myself/education?

My thesis is that the feds will watch &amp; wait to see if BA can clean up its act, and jump in to keep it solvent if a GM-type of implosion is near, and then highly regulate it and keep it around like an Airbus, and if that means that shareholders and executives get crammed, then so be it.

There are numerous savings accounts available for U.S. dollars, but finding a reliable HYSA for holding Euros, particularly one accessible to U.S. residents, seems to be much more difficult. Many people are familiar with digital banks and financial services, like Revolut, which offer the ability to hold accounts in multiple currencies, including Euros. However, Revolut and similar platforms appear to limit their higher interest rates on Euro-denominated accounts to individuals residing within the European Union (EU), making it inaccessible to those living in the U.S.

If anyone has insights into international banking options or can recommend HYSA alternatives for non-EU residents, I’d love to hear about your experiences.

This is where I need advice: we bought our home in April 2023 with an FHA loan for $196,000, and we still owe around $189,000. Our mortgage rate is 7.125%, and the monthly payment is about $1,800. I'm considering refinancing to lower the payment before my employment situation changes. Would refinancing be the best idea right now, and if so, what’s the best approach? I still hope to pay off the mortgage early, but having a lower monthly payment would make me feel more financially secure in the short term.

Any advise or wisdom here is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Is it normal to feel so compelled to work?," I am 17, in high school and currently work under my mother for a small business she owns, and recently some family troubles have required her to go out of state and have put my work schedule on a temporary halt. Why do I feel so anxious about this?? I’m paid rather well for my age, and I average 25-30 hours of work a week during the school year, as much of it can be done remotely while I’m at school. I have immediate access to a good amount of money (15-20k wont disclose here and I work full time in summer) plus a cash fund of 1600, gold, silver and platinum for emergencies, a Roth IRA with similar funds as in the above parenthesis to which I make contributions monthly to max out, as well as a paid off car and virtually no other expenses other than gas. Even college is paid for. I have a working budget and my spending accounts for less than 10% of what I make in a biweekly pay period, and I will be using the extra time I have now to get ahead in classes as the ones I take are accelerated, but why is the change in schedule so jarring for me? Even if it’s only a few day halt? It’s not like I need the extra money but it’s like not constantly bringing more in is shameful and I’m lazy. All of these thoughts are self perpetuated and I’m a little concerned about the compulsion given I’m in a spot of decent privilege. Would love to hear some thoughts.",1728015599.0,0,3,1fvqv3g
personalfinance,Worried about retirement ,"Hi all,

I'm worried about retirement and would like an honest perspective. I've read up on the common recommendations for savings goal, such as 1x salary saved by 30, 3x by 40, etc. But I'm not so sure how realistic that is.

I'm 38, married with 2 young children. My wife left work 3 years ago for the birth of of first kid and never went back. When I was 30, I had a net worth of like $500 in a checking account and a $50,000 a year job.

Today:
$190,000 in a 401k (maxing out the last 4 years)
$3,000 Roth IRA (new this month)
$80,000 cash emergency fund
$6,000 non-emergency fund savings

Wife has about $56,000 in her state pension but isn't actively contributing. She will once back to work in a few years.

I feel far behind and worried I'll have to work until I die. I know I should be saving more, but I'm struggling with the high costs of young children on a single income. 

What do you think? OK or do I need to double down and really try harder to cut expenses to save more aggressively?

When found a few days later, needles and meth were found in the vehicle, but otherwise vehicle was in good shape: no exterior damage and no engine damage (besides steering column). 

Progressive says they automatically consider vehicles with signs of drug use a total loss. After my $2k deductible, Progressive can either cut me a check for $13.5k and they keep the car, or a check for $9k and they give the car back to me in its current state. 

If I take the car back with the $9k, repair estimate (cleaning/decontamination and repair of steering column) is $5.5k; and that’s before considering the time needed to obtain salvage and rebuild titles. 

What should I do? Take the full $13.5k check, or the $9k and fix my car?

personalfinance,To Buy a house or Not to Buy a house,"I got lucky. Super lucky. I dropped out of college, got married and bought a house in the early 2016. Since then I've just been riding the wave of inflation feeling lucky that I have a house when most of my friends can't afford one now. Notwithstanding the last 3 years have been pretty rough. I've been laid off 4x in the last 3 years and have now finally found a more stable job. The thing is I HAVE to move for it and am not sure what to do with the house.
It's on a 3% loan.

I'm not sure what to do. I could sell, put the money from the house in an index fund and go back to renting. 

I could take the principal from the house and buy a cheap crappy house outright. (Though it'd be tight for the family size we are now)

Or I could go the comfort route and buy the same size house (though worse with a 6% loan) knowing it'll appreciate.

What would you do? I should note I don't think I can afford to keep both. I know that's the ideal, but with how volatile my field is, and how low our emergency fund is after the job gaps the risk in having two mortgages is too scary for me.",1728007349.0,2,10,1fvoeyi

I bought my house three years ago on a 30 year mortgage with a small down payment and still owe most of the original loan amount. He rents currently and his rent is 3x the amount of my payment (principle/interest, taxes, insurance). 
We split costs for meals out etc 50/50, which feels fair to me.

Any thoughts on how we should share this expense though? I see this question often but usually the person who owns the home makes the same or more. If he were to pay 2/3, he would be saving 3.5x as much as I would save by paying 1/3 instead of the full amount, because renting in our city is MUCH more expensive than my house, so he'd benefit even if I asked him to pay the majority, but is that fair?",1728006839.0,1,7,1fvo91e

I have two retirement accounts right now that come out of my paycheck automatically (TRS and 403b) and an HSA account. I’d like to setup any payments I can to my rewards credit card. The rest of my bills would autopay out of my checking account including a payment to the credit card. If possible I’d like to have two checking accounts. One where the bills auto pay out and one that’s just my spending money so I can easily tell how much spending I have left and I don’t over spend. Id like to have 3 savings account and payments going out to both each month but is that a dumb idea? One would be my emergency fund and after I get 3 months worth of bills in the account I’d want to stop payments to it and route the money to my other savings.

personalfinance,Car loan discrepancy,"Have a finance/loan question about a service contract refund applied to my car loan account. Based in California. 

On July 1, 2023 I financed my BMW including a 3-year maintenance service plan ($5,799). It was my first nice car and I was worried about the long term maintenance. There were a couple people ahead of me and finally got into the finance office well after the dealership closed, so I never got the chance to actually read the coverage until I got home. 

Car was financed with BMW Financial Services as that was the cheapest rate available (checked credit unions before getting there)...72 months (I know I know 🤦🏽‍♂️) at 6.99% with a 810 credit score. 

I emailed the dealership's finance person to cancel the service contract for a full refund as I was within the 60 days stated in the TOS. Received an email confirming the cancellation and that a full refund would be sent. 

The refund posted in September 2023, but about $840 was allocated to interest. BMW Financial's customer service basically said too bad, nothing we can do, and that I should have refinanced so that a check for the full amount could have been sent to me. Was also told I was overthinking it because they use simple daily interest calculation. Asked for a supervisor, but none were available. 

After about a month and a half of back and forth with the dealership's business office and finance person, they got confirmation from BMW Financial that they would be reallocating the payment so that 100% goes to principal. It would take them some time to do it and that I would see the reallocation on my March 2024 statement. 

Checked February 2024, March, April, and May statements and there was no reallocation and no draw down on the principal amount. Basically they just pasted the September refund showing that it was paid. 

The finance person said that when the refund “payment” was remitted to BMW Financial that there should have been a note attached stating that the remittance is to be 100% allocated to principal as it was a service contract refund. Clearly that didn't happen. 

Even with all of that and multiple back and forth emails with the finance person and the business office this past week, this still is not resolved. 

Trying to get this $840 discrepancy taken care of ASAP as I have been approved for 36 months at 4.99% (Navy Federal CU) and would obviously like to refinance. 

1) Am I overthinking this and, if so, should I just eat the $840?
2) If not, what is the best approach to escalate this past the dealership?

Background: Two months ago I got a new ISP to try it out, but it didn't work well for me so I returned it and called to cancel on day 13 of a 14 day trial. About a month ago I had received notification from that ISP that I had missed a payment so I immediately called them to correct the issue providing all the documentation saying I cancelled the service before the trial period was done and returned all of the equipment. The ISP corrected the error and said I didn't owe anything. Fast forward to last week I received a letter from a collection agency saying I owe money to them still. I have contacted the ISP they sent me an email stating ""I owe nothing on the account number and should be removed from any collections list. As well as the tracking number and date the equipment for them was returned"" I also have the document showing when I returned the equipment to the store, and a record of most of the phone call representative  numbers, dates and times with the ISP. 

  
How do I go about clearing my name with this credit agency? Do I send a debt validation letter first even though it has my name, account number, the date I got the internet but not the end date, and what a monthly cost would have been had I kept it for the full month?

Nothing I could really do to change that so the plan always disburses money back to me from the previous year so that I really end up only contributing around $13K. Knowing this is likely going to be the case, I've always just kind of maxed it out regardless knowing that disbursement will be coming. But I'm wondering if this is a good approach or not. 

Between when I make the contributions and when it gets disbursed back to me, there are still gains to be made. Are these accounted for in any way? I figure if I'm getting back a check for a flat amount, let's say $10k for simplicity sake, it gets taxed at that point just the same as if I never made the contribution at all. Except it gets a little time in the market to contribute to my plan's growth. Then once it gets bounced back to me (minus taxes, no penalty), then I could drop it into an IRA and/or other post-tax investment account.

My question is if this seems like an acceptable approach or what other factors I should be considering. I've thought about pre-emptively cutting it off when I hit $13k, but not sure it makes much of a difference one way or the other.

personalfinance,Is it possible to compute the pre-tax income necessary to earn a certain post-tax amount?,"I am a freelancer and my income can really vary over time. I have a pretty elaborate budget and tax spreadsheet that I update twice a month with info on my income so far in a year, and it extrapolates my income over the remainder of the year based on the current pace and computes what my taxes for the year would be at that pace. This can help me figure out if I'm above or below my earning goals relative to my budget.

The question, though: how MUCH am I above or below those goals? As people on this sub know, this is easier ask than answer. The current method I use is to compute my ""take home"" pay at my current earning pace by subtracting my quarterly tax payments from my freelance income, figure out what percentage that is of my current projected freelance, and then figuring out what freelance income would be necessary at that takehome percentage to meet my end-of-year goals. This works as a sort of blunt instrument, but because of the nature of progressive income taxation, it usually understates how much more I need to make if I'm short, because my take home pay percentage drops as my income goes up.

So, my question is: is there some mathematical way to start with the end result -- ""This is how much I need as takehome pay to cover my budget"" -- and use that to compute the pre-tax income I would need to in order to take home that amount? Basically, is there a way to work your way through the tax brackets, in reverse? You can do this iteratively, of course, by just doing the forward calculation with different pre-tax incomes until you get the result you need, but it feels like there should be a way to go backwards with it. (Assume that I know all the details about self-employment tax, fiddly aspects of the tax code, etc. -- I've been doing this a long time and my spreadsheet is VERY elaborate -- but it's the working-backwards-through-the-brackets part that I can never figure out how to do.)",1727992020.0,4,16,1fvj7p0
personalfinance,Does it make sense to split my 403(b) contributions between Roth and traditional?,"Context: 32, not married, salary 83k. My employer offers a mandatory 401(a) (5% contribution and 8% match), a 403(b) and a 457(b) (both with Roth options). I only got serious about retirement savings earlier this year and I feel like I have a lot of catching up to do. I currently have about 50k saved up in retirement accounts (34k in traditional employer plans and 16k in Roth IRA).

I live pretty frugally and I already have enough cash reserves for my emergency fund and a future home down payment, so I can afford to save about 50% of my income for retirement. My plan is to max the 457(b) and put the rest in the 403(b).

If am calculating correctly, this would knock me down from the 22% tax bracket well into the 12% tax bracket. Would it then make sense to contribute to the traditional 403(b) up to the threshold of the 12% tax bracket and the rest to the Roth 403(b)? I know traditional is usually better since it saves money from the top tax bracket, while distributions in retirement fill up tax brackets from the bottom up. But it feels like 12% is low enough to be worth contributing as Roth. Also, in case that matters for this, I live in a state (NJ) that does not exempt 403(b) contributions from state taxes.

personalfinance,"Good at making money, bad at investing. Help!","Hi everyone! Just like the title says - I am good at making money (and saving it) but not investing it. Short and sweet, I'm looking for advice on the following: 

1. What banks you would recommend. 

2. How would you invest $2.5M?

Backstory: I (28F) own a business with my father. We are in the construction industry. We bring in $65K profit each month. On the side, we have three rental properties, all positive. We are real estate savvy, and we flip one house per year give or take. We have $500K+ in the bank, which is usable and not needed for operating expenses.

On the personal side, my husband and do well. We live beneath our means. We do have a small amount of debt, $25K in student loans, and $40K for a bigger family car to fit us and our kids comfortably. We could pay these off today, but the interest rates are too low for us to really do it. The money makes us more sitting in the savings account. We are likely going to be inheriting about $5M in the next few years, for sure $2.5 M but there are other assets that will be added which brings the total to over $5M. I am extremely thankful for this, and feel very blessed, but extremely overwhelmed. 

I have always been good at not spending money. It mostly just sits an account, but I'd like my money to start making me money. Leading to my questions - how would you invest your money if you were in my situation? And what banks would you recommend? 

We are in Los Angeles, CA btw. ",1727988126.0,0,10,1fvhqbh

I plan on driving my 2001 Accord until it's no longer reliable, but I know that at 150,000 miles, the end might be near.

I currently earn between $60,000 and $75,000 per year before taxes (due to my freelancing). I have approximately $18,000 in savings, with $10,000 designated as my emergency fund.

After paying all my bills, I have about $1,800 left over each month.

I'm not specifically looking for any particular car; I just want something reliable for around $15,000 to $20,000. A small hybrid Toyota seems like what I'll likely settle on.

personalfinance,Big Tech Purchase Advice?,"I need a new computer because mine died on me. I have the option to buy a used computer for $600 or a new computer for $1200. I would have to pay cash for the used computer, but I could pay for the new computer in 12 monthly payments interest free. Given that the used computer is four years old, I would expect it to last 3-4 years, whereas I would expect the new computer to last 7-8, so the cost per year of ownership would likely be equivalent.

I live in a HCOL area and only make between 35-40k a year pretax, so the difference of $600 might be significant. That said, a monthly payment plan would mean less upfront, and I do expect my income to be higher over this next year. I also did just get out of debt last January, so the thought of owing money, even without paying interest, is a bit daunting.

An interest free payment plan, as long as it's properly paid off, seems like it's usually the right financial choice though, is that right? Or is there other insight y'all could offer on how to approach necessary large purchases like this?

Edit: Added details for my income because people were thinking I was in the federal low income bracket. I just don't make a lot of money. Not looking for free programs, just the best way to navigate a large purchase on a budget.",1727987542.0,1,5,1fvhi26

personalfinance,[US] Consequences to credit score of opening many cash back/rewards credit cards,"I am considering opening a series of cash back/rewards cards such that for most categories (at least most categories that I spend in with any regularity), but I am concerned about the consequences on my credit score. As it takes time to research and optimize, and I may find better choices later, I can't open them all in one month. A few months ago I opened the US Bank rewards card for my utility bills, which has saved me some money, and my vehicle happens to be a gas guzzler (I picked this one for other reasons) so a good 5% cash back on gas card (I am looking at Citi Custom Cash) would be good too. But, that would be the second new card that I have opened in the past few months. I also have two mortgages (personal property and investment property) which I got at the same time. I am concerned that starting a pattern of so many cash back cards could impact my credit score, which is a problem since I intend to refinance these mortgages in a bit less than a year and also get new mortgages for more investment properties. 

So, I ask: what is the impact on credit score from opening many credit cards and using them this way? I know that many credit applications can be seen as a sign of needing money, but this is not about needing more credit so perhaps something about this situation mitigates the credit score consequences here. 

This is not a debt risk for me. I do not spend money that I do not have (except for mortgages), and all my credit cards (including new ones should I open them) are on autopay for the full balance every month.",1727987117.0,1,8,1fvhbvm

I haven't invested money in the common stock or Employee Purchase Program in a long time. However, I do dividend reinvestment which occurs quarterly. The stocks price has grown significantly. I'm wondering two things:

1) Is it better to sell the Dividend Reinvestment portions (because some of the prices at which they were purchased are higher than the original stock purchase price). The dividend reinvestment's are clearly separate from the main stock holdings.

2) if I sell the Dividend Reinvestment portions, should I keep the dividend reinvestment made in the last year, so I am only taxed on long term gains? Or does that really not matter and I'm thinking too much about this?

  
I'm struggling on finding clear advise on this online. Most things I find are just ""when should I do dividend reinvestment?"" and nothing on the actual sale of them. Thanks!

Back in march I went to an initial visit at a dentist office, no dental insurance. I paid out of pocket 380$ for this visit. After this visit I was able to purchase dental insurance and did not go back for services until the insurance was valid.

Since march I have had a dental cleaning, and 2 fillings. I have paid out of pocket around 950$ with my dental insurance. A few weeks ago I went back in, and the office stated I needed another filling, as the cavity is severe and without further treatment will lead to a root canal. This is reasonable as the tooth causes me a lot of pain and the cavity is pretty visible.

I then get a paper from them stating that WITH my insurance I will need to pay them 690$ before I can get the treatment. At this point in the past 7 months I will have paid 1600$ for dental treatment. 

This may not seem like a lot, but I have drained my savings, I have to keep pulling out money because each time I need the treatment, it’s a high amount. I called my dental insurance company today telling them how much I’ve paid, and that it seemed fairly high. They told me that due to where the fillings were at it was considered a “downgrade” and when I asked what that meant, he didn’t explain and just said that the amount I have paid is most likely correct because of this.

I’m at a loss with this. I’m already established with this office, I’ve paid them a lot of money. I don’t know if I should just keep paying or just stop services and find somewhere else.

I cannot keep dipping into my savings to pay for this dental work, but I can’t afford to not have the work done. Any advice is appreciated.

personalfinance,Need advice about using one or two Roth IRAs,"Looking for advice about investing in my Roth IRA. My wife and I are on a budget and we share all finances. I started to contribute $75/week into my Roth IRA a few years ago and I have around $13k in my account. 

Since I am not maxing my Roth IRA out every year, does it make sense to split contributions to two accounts so that she has her “own” account? Or does it make more sense to continue contributing to just one account that already has a little bit of money in it?

Thanks for any advice!

Edit: Even though I can’t imagine separating (we’ve been together almost ten years and are very solid) it sounds like the best move is to start using two accounts. Thank you for all the advice!!",1727978735.0,1,8,1fve21i

investing,Dad Passed Away- Left Behind a Hefty Sum in Municipal Bonds and a high margin balance- What to do next?,"Dad passed away nearly 2 years ago  and one of the investment accounts he left behind is a Morgan Stanley account with a high six figure balance. I recently called Morgan Stanley to get an idea of the asset mix in the account and he told me that it’s all in municipal bonds, that is getting around 3% interest tax free. However, there’s also a margin balance on the account, from when my dad borrowed money from this account a few years ago. The Morgan Stanley account rep was surprisingly helpful in giving me a surface level understanding of what is happening in the account, but I’d like to get a more detailed understanding of how to address the margin balance. Morgan Stanley said it’s best we sell off however many municipal bonds shares we need to in order to pay off the margin balance, but that just seems like an easy way for them to get that balance paid off. The martin balance is roughly 40% of the total account balance. How do these margin balances work?  I’d prefer to just sell off all the municipal bonds and then reinvest all the money in stocks since I’m way more knowledgeable in that investment pool and have had my own success in stocks over the past 3-4 years. If that margin balance wasn’t in the picture, I’d already have sold off all the municipal bonds, but with that margin balance I want to make sure I make the most informed decision. Thanks all!

Here's the question: what if I have a stop order at $19 and someone fat-fingers a trade to sell ABC at $1.  Surely the $1 order will be filled.  And so my (and everyone one else's) stop orders would trigger?  Wouldn't this one instance of fat-fingering have the potential to cause a lot of ""unintended"" trades?

However, I expect now to be a good time to get in, as rates are beginning to get cut and the economy is expected to improve, increasing discretionary spending. The US is 80% of LULU sales. 

*Margins* - Lulu focuses on the premium athleisure market. This gives it higher margins than some of its competitors like Nike, Adidas. Moreover, its margins have improved over the years. 

*Valuation* - A company posting 8-9% growth at a time like this and trading at a PE of 21 seems like a bargain. Not to mention its sales in China are growing 15% or so (can’t recall exactly) 

*Insider buying* - insiders are buying the company stock. Recently, their CEO bought $1mm worth of stock. 

However, there seems to be intense competition from Alo and Vuori. I’m not even from the US but I’m seeing these names, especially Alo, pop up a lot more nowadays. Furthermore, some execution issues.

investing,Concerned About the Current Market Rally: Is It Sustainable?,"In my investing experience, I've never seen a market like this before—it has been on a nearly unbroken upward trajectory for the better part of the year, with the major indices up around 20% in less than 12 months. This seems unusual, especially given the economic uncertainty and potential headwinds we’re facing.

I’m curious if anyone else is concerned about the sustainability of this rally. Historically, we’ve seen strong market gains followed by significant corrections, especially when valuations appear stretched. Currently, many stocks have P/E ratios well above historical averages, which makes me hesitant to invest more heavily at these levels. I’m worried that we might be in a bubble, and that a significant pullback could be on the horizon.

I would love to hear from the community:

1. How are you navigating this market environment?
2. Are you still finding value in specific sectors or stocks, or are you shifting to a more defensive strategy?
3. Do you think this rally is justified given the macroeconomic conditions, or are we ignoring potential risks?
4. For those who have been through similar market phases before, how did you manage your portfolio during such times?

investing,Help a poor grad student make lunch money in passive income? ,"Hello all. I am new here and I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I'm a perpetual student - that being said, I'm almost 30 and I'm working on my final degree, in a field that doesn't pay very well, at an institution that is railing against giving student workers a living wage of any kind. Read: I'm old now, and I'm still poor. I come from a family who is also now old and relatively poor, i.e. won't put their $ into a high-yield savings because they're so anxious to move $ around, desperately afraid of losing anything that no risk is acceptable.

I have some savings from undergrad that I've blown through a considerable amount of paying bills in graduate school. I've been paying off my private undergraduate debt at a 5.6% interest rate consistently over the last 8 years - to the point where I've paid the loan ""off"" twice already, but of course interest is a thing, so I've finally reached the point where the interest gets paid on a monthly basis and I'm slowly but steadily eating into the principal. Making my payments each month, I should have the biggest loan paid off by mid-2030s, and the federal ones are just gonna do what they do (on in-school deferment for now, but I'm hoping the government is gonna do SOMETHING). 

  
I NEED to stop blowing through my savings, and I'd love my money to make me some money each month to help offset the cost of bills and help me not have sleep for dinner all the time. It's currently all sitting in a HPY long-term savings account with minimal withdrawals, earning about 4.4% in interest that gets paid out monthly. 

  
Now, 4.4% is pretty good I imagine, and it's bringing me in a hundred or two hundred bucks each month, but I'm not sure if diversifying my investments might help create longer term financial stability? I don't really have any more than $20 invested in actual stocks, which I got into on Robinhood (lol I know), back when the big Dogecoin craze went down and I was thrilled to have made $30 off of that. 

Some context: my situation is a little unique in that I am employed by the institution at which I am doing my thesis, but they structure our contract in such a way that we have extremely minimal protection and minimal financial opportunities. I do not have access to retirement plans/401k/IRAs etc through my job, nor do I have access to life insurance, financial advising, etc. I'd like to grow the $ as much as possible but I am nervous to put a LOT of it into something that would render it non-fluid in case there is an emergency I need to cover, etc. 

School me on what I can do better? Are there any stocks I \*should\* be investing in? Is there something I'm missing? Is there better yield than 4.4% out there on savings in some sort of program I don't know about?",1726761776.0,0,32,1fkogay

Use this reddit flowchart: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how\_to\_prioritize\_spending\_your\_money\_a\_flowchart/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/)

Sear this stat into your brain: 94.8% of actively managed funds (by all those smart Ivy League people who study all those graphs and look at all those monitors) [underperform the market over 20 years](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/business/stock-market-2022.html).

Why are the finance folks so rich then? They get paid a percentage of the money they manage in addition to a slice of the profits. Their main business is convincing investors to give them money to manage, making gains is literally a bonus. Also, it is totally possible to beat the market in the short-term, but you never know how short it will be.

The market will stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid. Markets do not respond to news the way you think they will. All seemingly good arguments are made retroactively, and all the bad predictions are forgotton.

People make predictions all the time. You only remember the people who got it right. Classic survivorship bias.

Time in the market beats timing the market.

Don't invest any money you might need in the next 5 years.

Start moving your money into more conservative investments when you're 10 years out from retirement, as the worst shocks can take 7-8 years to recover.

Since 1926, [the market was at an all-time high for 30% of the months](https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/scared-of-investing-when-the-stock-market-is-at-an-all-time-high-you-shouldn-t-be/). All time highs are not indicators you should not invest because as long as the all time high is still lower than the 20 year-later point when you take out your money, you're still going to gain.

It's okay to invest short-term and in individual stocks and in Crypto. Just know that it's gambling and not investing. Imagine I told you that there was a stock that I could GUARANTEE will give you a 49% chance of increasing by over 100% in the next HOUR, but only if you invest right now, would you take it? It's a great offer right? Yup. It exists. It's called ""black"" or ""red"" in Roulette, and it's available in literally every casino.

Keep it as simple as possible. The more complex you make it the more you think your decisions have control over short-term outcomes, the more likely you are to be tempted to move the money around. Whatever will help you ""set it and forget it"" will likely yield more gains in the long term than any short-term maximization.

It is not guaranteed that large cap US index funds will continue to rise in value forever, but it is basically guaranteed that they will be correlated to the US Economy. If you believe that the US Economy will grow and continue to be an international linchpin, if you believe that US laws will continue to favor large corporations and mechanism to make rich people more rich, and if you think the US won't get into a war on home soil they can't win, then large cap US index funds have the highest risk/return ration of a bet as you can make. Otherwise, you can invest in a world index.

Okay, that's everything I've ever learned on every thread from  r/investing and r/personalfinance  - I posted this as a comment in another thread, but I figured I make it it's own post, in case others want to chime in on their main takeaways during their time lurking here.

- 1% in fees, in a year where you got 10% in gains is actually 10%-11% of your gains put into fees. In a year where you earned 5%, 1% in fees eats up 20% of your gains.

EDIT:

The most interesting investing scam thought experiment I read about that helped me understand how strong survivorship bias is, is one where the scammer put out an ad for an email list for free stock tips. He got thousands of people. He spilt the email list in half and told half of them to buy, and half of them to sell. The half for whom his prediction was correct, he emailed the next week, and he did the same thing. After 5 times of this, he ended up with a couple hundred people who believed this man to be a stock picking genius: 5 in a row, correct every time, with all the analytics and charts and historical reasoning to back it up. So at this point, they were knocking his door down to give him money to invest for them. Even after he got money, he used the same technique, and after 5 more splits, he ended up with 20 people for whom he had been right 10 times in a row and made them more money than they'd ever had with another investor. So they put their whole lifesavings with him.

The thing about picking stocks is that you can often be the scammer and the mark.

investing,Dump Evolution Gaming (EVO),"So if you've ever gambled online you've probably used Evolution Gaming. They're the guys that let you play casino table games like Blackjack from the comfort of your own home.

They're a huge company at this point, they have studios all over Europe and North America. Their stock is known for performing well and is often recommended for long term investments.

Despite all the success, they treat their employees like shit, so much so that 200 of their employees in Georgia went on strike due to their low wages, lack of hygiene, insect bites and lack of air conditioning: https://www.breakit.se/artikel/21271/strejkuppror-pa-evolution-gaming-200-personer-strejkar-mot-laga-loner-och-insektsbett

But that's not what I'm here to talk about, I'm here to show you that they are committing fraud in broad daylight. Yes, casinos are rigged, we know the house has an advantage, we accept that when we gamble. But this is not about that, this is about them intervening and controlling the games in a way that cannot be described as typical or fair casino behavior.

First, let's have a look at this video from a Russian gambler playing ""Crazy Time"". It's a spinning wheel game, where you can bet on the outcome. The flapper lands on ""Pachinko"", which is one of the best outcomes, this should activate a bonus round, where the largest of wins usually occur. But instead of this happening, an awkward pause ensues, and after a delay of 3 or so minutes, they just continue spinning the wheel. No explanation is provided, they change host, and the game goes on.

See it for yourself: https://youtu.be/m_qE0GmgzrE?t=46

But we're just getting started. There are COUNTLESS examples of this in all types of games.

Here we have an example from a similar game but with a different theme (Monopoly Live). The flapper lands on 4 rolls, this is the absolute best outcome in this game. But they decide it doesn't count, and just keep spinning. Just like in the previous video, no explanation is provided and the host is changed shortly after. It’s almost if there is a protocol for this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO0DYk_asBw

This next one doesn’t need much of an explanation. In the video, a gambler playing roulette notices that as the ball lands on the number 10 (where he, and presumably others had placed a bet), the ball literally flies to the number 1, where he, and I imagine a lot less people, had placed a bet.

https://youtu.be/xPsncW1gqjk?t=86

Another one from Monopoly Live. This one doesn’t even need an explanation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM6ptZ8XU_0

In this example, a French streamer is playing blackjack. Dealer's upcard is 10, and the player gets a hard 16. He decides to hit. Before the dealer has even scanned the card, he can somehow know that he has ""too many"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIcdo58XVy4

These are just a few of the many examples I've seen. I’m telling you there are COUNTLESS videos like this online. And just imagine how many aren’t being recorded? What are the chances this happens again and again and someone happens to be recording? That cannot be very likely, and should surely lead to some kind of investigation. IF that happens, the stock will plummet. I say it's only a matter of time.

EDIT: and just look at the comment sections on these videos, people are almost all in agreement about this. i made a reddit thread on /r/gambling and people generally seem agree that evolution is shady: https://www.reddit.com/r/gambling/comments/1fjc5wl/evolution_gaming_scam_exposed/",1726695902.0,0,1,1fk4jrs

A little background:  
  
I am not from a wealthy background nor do I have a wealthy circle of friends, so I have limited people to reach out to for advice preparing and transferring wealth to children.  
  
Some general information.  Married, Mid 30's, two children under 4.  We make around 500k and that will increase to about 6-700k next year.  I am confident we will retire just fine with our investments.  
  
We're fortunate to have GI Bill available split between our kids, so we will only need to pay for half of their school.  I plan on having about 1-200k available for each of their education funds (today's dollars).  I will increase this fund if we use private school.  I would love to roll over 35k over to a Roth IRA for them once eligible.  

In addition I would like to set up custodial brokerages under their names, but I do not want to hand the keys to it all over at 18.  I would like it to hand over incrementally until they're in their late 20s. 

Questions:

Does my plan for a custodial brokerage line up with setting up a trust?  I am not familiar with the specifics of a trust.  Any recommended text for this topic or should I reach out to an estate lawyer?

Any recommended books specifically for financially educating my children specifically (I feel well versed in financial educated and would like to pass this to my kids)?  

Am I missing any glaring financial vessels I should be using for my kids?

investing,Wash sale rule explanation - Am I understanding this right?,"I made a lot of trades in 2024, I was up 50k at one point and then gave back almost all the profit and I am only up around 4k currently for 2024. I am assuming I only have to pay capital gains taxes on 4k profit for the year, not 50k or some figure more than my overall gains of 4k because of wash sale rule. I did lot of day trading and buying same stock within 30 days of selling and I wanted to understand the implications of wash sale rule. I currently have sold all my positions and do not hold any stock/options and I am up 4k on the year.

Example 1: I bought NVDA calls on August 14, sold on August 15 for gains of 5k. Then I bought NVDA calls on August 20 and sold on August 25 for loss of 3k. I did this several times with NVDA stock and options and have profit of 20k from NVDA and loss of 19k with overall net gain of around 1k on NVDA. I am trying to understand wash sale rule and my understanding is I only have to pay capital gains taxes for 1k on NVDA. My cost basis on my second purchase gets adjusted from profit on first purchase and my cost basis for third purchase gets adjusted based on profit/loss from second sell and so on for future purchase. Is this correct statement? Also, I currently do not hold any NVDA stocks or options, I sold them all.

Example 2: I did same thing with AMZN stock too. I bought calls, sold for some loss, bought more calls within 30 days and sold for some profit and rinse and repeat. I did this multiple times throughout the year.

I traded mostly tech stocks and at one point was in profit in excess of 50k. However I did not sell at the top and the stocks came crashing down and I lost all my profit. At one point I lost all profit and was 20k down on my cost basis too. I was able to recover my loss and I am up 4k in the year. I am now thinking about my Uncle sam and how much does he want for 2024. With no current positions in any stock/options currently, my thinking is just taxes on 4k profit.

investing,Reallocating my portfolio: current situation and next steps,"**Hello everyone,**

I'm a 31-year-old Italian expat currently working in Switzerland, and I'm looking for some advice on how to improve my investment strategy. I have a long term horizon and I'm willing to take risks. I have a few accounts with investments and a substantial amount of liquidity that I'd like to put to work. Here’s a breakdown of my current situation:

**Main Investing Account (Italy):**

* **Portfolio Value:** €30K (+14%)

   * **72% in ETF:** iShares MSCI World (SWDA) green, currently up +32%

   * **8% in Amazon (AMZ):** green, up +32%

   * **20% in Single Stocks:** deeply red (-40%) due to early mistakes (chasing squeezes, long-term bets on CTXR &amp; NIO)

* **Liquidity:** €3K

**Swiss Account:**

* **Liquidity:** 38K CHF

* **Emergency Fund:** 10K CHF in cash

 

**Other stocks: 5K€** from shareholder program of my previous employee (frozen until 2026)

**Additional Info:**

* I've been investing €500 monthly in my Italian account, but currently, I have no more liquidity there and prefer to keep the remaining €3K as a buffer.

* I recently opened an Interactive Brokers account, but I’m unsure how to proceed with the available liquidity in my Swiss account.

* I have a savings potential of 2K CHF per month, which I plan to use for future investments.

**My Questions:**

1. **Should I start accumulating on Interactive Brokers?** I’m considering investing in another ETF like VTI or VOO and just letting it grow over time.
2. I’m considering adding a **gold ETF, any suggestion?**

1. **Should I consider selling everything and pivot to a dividend growth investing strategy?** I’m curious if this might be a better path for long-term stability.
2. **Other suggestions or comments?** I’m open to any advice on how to best optimize my current position and make the most of my savings potential.
3. I don’t have any asset allocated on **BITCOIN**, should I think about 5%?

investing,"Feedback on this portfolio? 43 yr old 0 in Roth IRA, starting out","Hey everyone! Looking for some feedback on my investment strategy for my Roth IRA. I’m starting from scratch with $0 and have a 22-year time horizon ahead of me. Here’s the allocation I’m considering:

- \*\*VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF) - 60.00%\*\*

- \*\*IJR (iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF) - 15.00%\*\*

- \*\*IJH (iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF) - 5.00%\*\*

- \*\*VTV (Vanguard Value ETF) - 20.00%\*\*

**### \*\*My Thinking Behind This Allocation:\*\***

1. \*\*VOO - 60%\*\*: This forms the core of my portfolio, providing broad exposure to the S&amp;P 500. I’m looking for long-term growth with established, large-cap U.S. companies across various sectors. The S&amp;P 500’s historical performance is strong, and I like the idea of having this as my main holding because of its stability and proven track record.

2. \*\*IJR - 15%\*\*: I’m including small-cap stocks to capture higher growth potential. I know they can be more volatile, but I’m willing to ride that out given my long time horizon. I’m hoping this segment will add some aggressive growth to my portfolio.

3. \*\*IJH - 5%\*\*: Mid-cap stocks offer a good balance between stability and growth potential. They’re typically more established than small caps but still have significant room to expand. I’m allocating a smaller percentage here to capture that middle ground between large and small-cap stocks.

4. \*\*VTV - 20%\*\*: I’m adding a value tilt with VTV to include more defensive, dividend-paying stocks that are often undervalued. My goal is to have a bit of a safety net with this allocation, especially during market downturns when value stocks typically hold up better than growth stocks.

### \*\*Why This Portfolio?\*\*

- \*\*Diversification Across Market Caps\*\*: By including large, mid, and small caps, I’m aiming to capture a wide range of growth opportunities across different company sizes. I like the idea of spreading my risk and not putting all my eggs in the large-cap basket.  

- \*\*Value Component for Stability\*\*: The value focus with VTV should help provide some cushion during downturns, especially since value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks during recessions. I also appreciate the dividend income that value stocks can provide, adding another layer to my returns.

- \*\*Long-Term Growth Potential\*\*: I believe this portfolio balances growth and stability well, which feels right for my 22-year investment horizon. My goal is to maximize my Roth IRA’s growth potential over time while managing risk.  


### \*\*Questions for the Community:\*\*

- \*\*Am I missing anything important here?\*\* I’m wondering if there’s something I should be adding or adjusting to make this even stronger.

- \*\*Thoughts on the allocation percentages?\*\* Are these weights balanced well, or would you adjust them? For instance, should I tweak the value allocation or add more to mid or small caps

- \*\*International Exposure?\*\* I’ve heard mixed advice about adding international stocks. I’m currently 100% U.S.-focused. Is that okay for a Roth IRA, or should I be looking to diversify more globally?

- \*\*Overall Risk Level?\*\* Do you think this is a suitable risk level for someone starting from $0 with a 22-year horizon, or should I be more aggressive/conservative?

Thanks in advance for any insights or advice! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1726634134.0,3,7,1fjkl7u
investing,How do YOU calculate subsequent investment returns?,"I've been using small amounts to learn about 0DTE options (&lt;$100). I've had some ups and downs but so far I'm in the positive. I'd like to see how much these are actually returning and whether it's worth my time and energy to supplement my account by doing this. I've been doing some various calculations to see what seems to make sense, but the one part I can't really find anywhere is how to quantify the return if you're basically **reinvesting the same initial money over and over**. Here's a simplified scenario:

||Bought $|Sold $|Profit $|Return %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Option 1|$100|$140|$40|40%|
|Option 2|$100|$80|-$20|-20%|
|Option 3|$100|$110|$10|10%|
|Option 4|$100|$125|$25|25%|
|Option 5|$100|$70|-$30|-30%|

Calculation 1: I started with $100 and ended with $125, so my return is 25%.

Calculation 2: Each time I risked $100, for a total of $500. I profited $25 on that $500 risked, so my return is 5%.

Calculation 3 (geometric mean/TWR): ((1+.40) \* (1-.20) \* (1+.10) \* (1+.25) \* (1-.30)) – 1 = 7.8%

/ZQU24 (September 2024) is currently trading at 94.8275.

The effective federal funds rate is currently 5.33%: [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

If I understand the specs correctly,

- /ZQU24 will settle on Sep 30, 2024 (last trading day of the month) 

- For the first 18 days of the month, the EFFR was / will be 5.33%. So that’s a weighted average of 18 / 30 \* 5.33% = 0.6 \* 5.33%.

- Or is it based on business days? If so, that’s 12 days out of 20 (excluding Sep 2 &amp; weekends), which is still 0.6 \* 5.33%.

- The Federal Reserve may reduce the federal funds rate by 0.25% or 0.50%. Assuming it’s 0.25%, the EFFR for the latter 40% of September should be approximately (5.33 - 0.25%). So combine that with 60% \* 5.33% and you get a blended average of 5.23%, or 94.77 for the contract value.

- If the Federal Reserve cuts by 0.50%, you get a blended EFFR of 5.13%, or 94.87.

- The current market price of 94.8275 suggests it’s a pretty even split, with a slight bias towards the 0.50% cut.

- Potential profit would be (94.87 - 94.8275) / 0.005 \* $20.42 = $173.57 (on $200 margin) upon a correct bet on a 0.5% cut, and potential loss would be (94.77 - 94.8275) / 0.005 \* $20.42 = -$234.83 upon an incorrect bet on a 0.5% cut.

investing,Starting retirement saving at 55,"I'm two years into my investing journey and I feel that l'm ready to help guide my parents into investing, the issue is, they're 55 and have nothing.

The first step will be figuring out their income and expenses and see what they can begin to invest. I've got that.

My uncertainty is HOW they should be allocated once they do begin to invest. At 55, conventional wisdom would say 55% bonds; vanguards 2035 target fund is 30% bonds. But they have a lot of ground to make up in a short time period.

investing,Why is Roth better because of tax free growth?,"I often hear people say that one of the main benefits of Roth vs Traditional retirement accounts is that it grows and compounds tax free. I'm trying to understand what exactly is meant by this benefit because the amount that you end up withdrawing in retirement will always be the same given that the tax bracket remains when you contribute vs withdrawal.

If I invest $100 today in a Traditional account and it grows 10x to $1000, if my marginal tax rate is 25% then I end up with $750

If I invest $100 today in a Roth,  I pay the 25% before I contribute. Making my contribution $75, which then grows 10x to $750 which I withdrawl tax free.

I know that there are other benefits to each type of account, but I'm specifically asking about the point I always hear about ""Tax Free Growth"". The math doesn't seem to indicate that you end up with more money if your account grows tax free, so what meant by the benefit of tax free growth?",1726601341.0,61,187,1fj8dgb

I’ve been steadily investing in index funds (mostly SPY) and a few solid individual stocks. I follow the ""boring"" advice — DCA, hold long-term, don’t panic sell etc — and it’s worked really well. The thing is that I look at people with massive portfolios, and it’s crazy how easy it seems for the rich to get richer. For example, if you had $10M in SPY at the start of this year, you’d be up $1.5M already. That just feels... surreal?

It’s like, what value is actually being created here? I’ve been investing for years, but seeing how money can just *grow* like this makes me question if it’s all just a game of compounding and luck. Sure I’m happy with my returns, but what’s the real value behind this? Have any of you ever felt this way — like investing is almost too easy once you hit a certain point?

I’m not trying to sound ungrateful, but I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts. Am I overthinking this? Or is this just how the game works once you reach a certain level? Any insights or similar experiences would be awesome to hear!",1726585013.0,643,391,1fj1dvj

investing,How is wash sale not a double hit? Sorry for another wash sale Q. ,"Lets say I bought the stock at $1000 and sold it at $900.  
i realized $100 loss. it's out of my cash balance. (1st hit). this is fair.

Then i buy again at $500 and sell it at $700. But because of wash sale, my cost basis is now $600, (2nd hit) (unfair?)  
And i gain $100, although in actuality, I bought it at $500 and sold at $700.

In a world where there is no such thing as wash sale, i would have gained $200 profit.  
So minus the 1st loss, I'd end up $200-$100 = $100 gain.

but with bcos of wash sale: $100-$100 = $0 gain.

so again in summary:

i lost $100. thats gone. (1st hit)  Then for the 2nd trade, even if i make profit, profit will be always lesser. (2nd hit)

is this right? i'm pretty sure it's right but chatgpt keep saying its not a double hit. but only tax purposes. and the loss is ""deferred"".

im like how is my loss deferred when i already lost $100. gone and cleared.  
If i get a refund of $100 (when i re-buy) + higher average worth of $100. Then its single hit. fair and square imho. but thats only in a fantasy.

what am i missing? or is it just that wash sale is a bad boy for traders?

investing,Accidental Wash Sales and IRA Accounts,"I'm a new investor. I'm hoping to (1) diversify my portfolio to reduce its volatility and (2) improve tax efficiency by allocating low-dividend securities into my taxable brokerage and high-dividend securities into my tax advantaged Roth IRA.

Part of this process will include selling FTEC from my Roth IRA at a very small loss and repurchasing it in my taxable brokerage, since it has a low dividend yield. (I understand that it's a sector ETF with relatively high volatility and uncompensated risk, but I'm okay with this position, especially as it would replace some even higher risk small-cap stocks in my portfolio, so the net effect would be replacing small-cap stock -&gt; FTEC -&gt; broad index ETF.)

I also understand that generally, the cost basis in the IRA doesn't matter, but you can [accidentally trigger the wash sale rule](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/09/ira-wash-sale-rule.asp) if you sell a security in a taxable account at a loss, then repurchase within 30 days in your IRA. In this case, I'm trying to do the opposite--sell from the IRA, then repurchase within 30 days (in fact, immediately) within my taxable--if I can confirm this wouldn't trigger the wash sale.

I've also considered purchasing VGT instead of FTEC, but I'd rather go with the lower expense ratio of FTEC if I can be confident about the rule.",1726552274.0,4,4,1firc1j
investing,The logic view on rate cuts ,"Source:  The Economist 

The longed-for moment is almost here. For two and a half years, ever since America’s Federal Reserve embarked on its fastest series of interest-rate rises since the 1980s, investors have been desperate for any hint of when it would reverse course. Now it would be a huge surprise if Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chair, did not announce the first such reduction after its rate-setting committee meets on September 18th. 

Indeed, among traders, the debate is no longer “whether” but “how much”. Market pricing implies roughly a 40% chance that officials will cut their policy rate, currently between 5.25% and 5.5%, by 0.25 percentage points, and a 60% chance that they will instead opt for 0.5.Going by how investors have reacted to Mr Powell’s pronouncements over the past couple of years, you might think this is unadulterated good news for them. After all, America’s stockmarket has spent much of that time cratering whenever it looked like interest rates would stay higher for longer, and soaring on any suggestion that borrowing costs might soon come down. But it is not for nothing that “buy the rumour, sell the fact” is such an enduring mantra in financial markets. For all that the prospect of rate cuts sets investors’ pulses racing, their actual arrival has often proved disappointing.Consider how share prices have responded to past loosening cycles. 

Although the three episodes in the 1990s, when Alan Greenspan was at the Fed’s helm, did give the stockmarket successive boosts, this century’s record has been drearier. Rate cuts in the early 2000s took place during the bursting of the dotcom bubble; those starting in 2007 coincided with the market crash that accompanied the global financial crisis. The doveish turn that began in 2019 buoyed share prices at first, but the effect was then swamped by the onset of the covid-19 pandemic.

**Like so much in finance, rate cuts have a small effect on share prices (in this case a positive one) that is easily obscured by other factors. The fillip comes from a reduction in borrowing costs, which allows companies to keep more of their profits and encourages customers to spend more on their products. If bond yields also fall, prospective returns on shares become that much more attractive by comparison, providing another boost.What, then, might be the swamping factors this time? One is perennial: that money never gets cheaper in isolation, but because central bankers fear economic weakness and want to stave it off. Just now, that seems like less of a worry than normally is the case.** **True, America’s labour market has cooled, which prompted a brief growth scare among shareholders over the summer. However, unusually for the end of a tightening cycle, the economy appears to be merely slowing down rather than entering a recession**. 

Company profits should therefore be safer than usual as the Fed begins to cut—and so should share prices.More worrying are the infamous “long and variable lags”, as named by Milton Friedman, between changes in monetary policy and their impact on companies and consumers. Counterintuitively, even as the Fed prepares to loosen, many borrowers will face steeper interest bills. Any firm that issued fixed-rate debt while money was nearly free, which is plenty of them, will eventually need to refinance. Since there is little prospect of the Fed returning interest rates close to zero any time soon, debt-servicing costs for such firms will be rising for some time yet. Homeowners on fixed-rate mortgages who need to refinance (after moving house, for instance) will be in a similar position. So rate cuts may energise the economy, and hence the stockmarket, less today than they would have done in the past.The biggest hint that the Fed’s largesse will disappoint investors, though, is the extent to which it is already expected by the market. Already, traders’ central expectation is for 1.25 percentage points’ worth of cuts before the year is out, followed by another 1.25 next year. Such rapid moves have only occurred in the past amid recessions or crises. There is plenty of room, in other words, for Mr Powell to surprise on the hawkish side even as he slashes rates, which would raise bond yields and make stocks less attractive. Rate cuts ought to be good for the stockmarket. But not if investors have already pocketed their benefits.

investing,Why do people constantly refer to 1999?,"We are investing in 2024, not 1999

Many people, many of which are younger with good investment time horizons (10 years+) are constantly steered away from investing in tech and in particular, QQQ with a constant reference to the crash of 1999 and the recovery time

While that’s a good and valid event to refer to, the fact is it was a crash that happened 25 years ago. Quarter of a century

We are far from 1999 times where technology is skeptical. We use technology in our every day lives and more and more as time goes on

The absolute fact is that investing in 2024 and beyond is not comparable to investing in 1999. Times are extremely different and we have a plethora of knowledge and resources at our fingertips, something that didn’t exist in 1999 or wasn’t as accessible 

If tech crashes as it did in 1999, the implications would extend far far past the stock market and thinking logically, it won’t ever happen. Technology is far ingrained in our every day lives, we would struggle to operate in our modern world without it 

If you had invested in QQQ any time in the last 16 years, you’ve beaten the S&amp;P 500… but 1999…

Why are people so discouraged to invest in and play strengths in the market? Tech has led and will continue to lead the market. There will be a time where it doesn’t but there’s enough resources out there to indicate when tech is trading into weakness. We have resources accessible that we didn’t have in the 90s.

Now I'm considering going all in on my 457b at 25% for the first 6 months and then switching 25% to my 401k for the later part of the year. Doing so would more than likely allow me to max my 457 and come a few hundred shy of maxing out my 401k. There is no employer match and I would still contribute my max amount to my Roth IRA in January. I don't qualify for an HSA.

I know most people aren't in this predicament but would I be crazy? I wouldn't see a sizable hit in my financial well being as I have another 3.5% pay increase in 2025 and a 4% pay increase in 2026. 

For context, my base pay is currently $102k and with a steady 32 hours of OT a paycheck, I'm projected to make $180k this year. I also receive VA Compensation so that goes directly into a HYSA to collect interest which doesn't get touched. ",1726501424.0,0,4,1fi7w18

I have an old 401k from a previous employer with fidelity, worth ~130k. I stopped contributing in 2020 (Covid layoff)

I have 3 funds, rough weight 
2055 target date 30%
Fidelity growth fund -50%
Sp500 index 20%

The 2055 target date has grown 24% in total where the fidelity growth and sp500 index have grown 170% and 104% respectively. 

Why such slow growth in the target fund? I thought it was mostly equities and low bonds  since I’m 30 yrs out. Should I rebalance? I’m no longer contributing here, should I convert to an IRA or let it sit as is?

Thank you!

personalfinance,30k in lender credits is making it hard to decide between FHA and Conventional,"Closing on a new construction and using the builders preferred lender. 

The pros and cons I’ve listed below are my current terms with the max amount of the concession going towards buying down the rate. 

Loan amount is $499,583.00. Both have an estimated monthly payment of $3,500.00 and this is with exceptional credit.


FHA Pros:
- 4.625 Rate
- 30k of concession
- 3.5% down

FHA Cons:
- $8,600.00 in MIP
- $220.00 in PMI

Conventional Pros:
- No MIP
- $85.00 PMI (Which will eventually fall off)

Conventional Cons:
- 5.49 Rate
- $25k of concession
- 5.00% down


I hate that I’m stuck with the MIP and PMI, but from my math (which could be wrong) I’d be paying an extra $100k in interest over the life of the loan if I went with conventional. I know things change, but currently planning on being in this home forever.

I’m not a huge spender, definitely putting under $1k on the card a month. I might travel more as I progress in my career, but i’m not in a rush to get free hotel nights.

should I still open another credit card for points since they add up anyways? I know there’s usually like $100 annual fee or something. 

I guess i’m wondering if there’s a way someone who is a smaller spender like me could still benefit from credit cards or if it would just cost me more with the annual fee?

I earn a good amount of money on jobs though they haven’t been as consistent so on average it’s looking like $25-30K/yr. (only been in the industry for about 3yrs)

For the last 3 months my income is averaging $3.5K-$5.5K. 
But I haven’t been able to make proper payments to reduce my balances, all my cards are close to their limit or have exceeded.

My thought is that if we take a HELOC (specifically a HELOC as we don't know how much we'll need for repairs and want to have flexibility there) for $100k the starting payments will be around $750/mo which would be less than the monthly car payment + credit card payments. With SoFi it seems like we'd need to withdraw 75% / $75k and sit on that for 90 days, but then after that I could use what we need drop a payment back of $60k+ and have even lower payments.

personalfinance,searching for a new bank and my first credit card,"just like the title says! 

I’m originally from Miami, spent my time growing up there. When I got older, my parents opened me up some credit Union bank account, checking and saving. It worked and continues to work mostly fine, but after 4 years in school and 2 years out of school just rawdogging adulthood here in Chicago, im now realizing I probably want another bank. for starters, I like having the option of going to a physical location for some of my banking needs. this Miami credit union has only one location nearby me, and it’s a sister branch that’s only open limited hours on weekdays. It’s not very convenient at all. On top of that, the interest rate on the savings account is only 0.04%…

I’m feeling ready to make a switch. I want a bank that has more convenient locations and atms that are nearby and open more often. It doesn’t need to be around all of the US, since I don’t travel all that much. So something that’s at least prevalent in Chicago. Additionally, I’d ideally want to find a better savings interest rate, at least for the short term before I figure out stocks and investment and all that stuff. I’ve heard Chase recommended, as well as Capital One. I’ve even seen some recommend credit unions. So I’m at a lose for where to switch to, or even if I should switch. I would love some advice.

Tied up in this question, though, is another question: what should my first credit card be? To be fair, the question is a little misleading. I already had one credit card. When I was leaving for college, my parents gave me a capital one card under my name, to use a couple hundred a month when I needed, that they would pay off. It helped build a bit of credit, but now that I’m out of school I’ve lost my access to this card, leaving me with no credit card. My credit isn’t amazing (high end of fair, just below good) and I’m just looking for something that will accept my application. Something simple and easy to help build up my credit. I’ve heard that there’s some convenience from getting your bank accounts and credit card from the same place, so I’m considering that. But again, very open to suggestions and advice. I really don’t know as much as I’d like about personal finance, and I’m trying to learn to do better and make sure I’m doing everything right.

Lastly, I'm waiting to hear back on an apartment that will only be $1,000/month on rent, and I may be able to move there as soon as December. So that may save me $200.

I also plan to study for the MCAT for med school at some point. Coming from less money, I definitely wanted to save up beforehand so med school probably won't happen until I'm 30-31. I also would like to study in Spain for 2 months before med school. Not sure if that would be feasible with the money I have right now, but I do have a savings goal of $30,000 by next summer. I think I can get there. I don't eat out hardly ever.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! As well as any input on how I could be investing, which I've never done before besides retirement. I just want to be sure that I'm safe and in a good situation financially. I've had money insecurity my whole life, so I'm also just looking for reassurance that I'm doing okay.

personalfinance,Rent-stabilized Apartment vs Buying a Condo in NYC?,"I’m single, in my mid 20s and earn around $200k/year with $300k net worth. I plan on staying childfree in the future and will probably go the DINK route. I’ve seen some affordable 1bd condos in the city around the 250-400k range and was considering either buying one in the next year or 2, or instead looking for a rent stabilized 1bd apartment and just renting indefinitely. I'm wondering what would make more sense financially in my position? From my research it doesn't seem like owning is really worth it in NYC, but is it different for these more affordable condos? If it is worth it, what should I look for in a good condo? Thanks!

personalfinance,Inheritance from a trust but not for a while,"I'm 32m single and will have some money coming in from a trust down the road but not likely for a long time. My Uncle and Aunt own the land on 2 fast food properties with a 20+ year triple net lease on them in California. That brings them in $10k each per month. The only trust I will get is from my uncle. My aunt isn't in as great shape health wise so whatever she leaves will go to my uncle. He is a retired attorney and has no kids and set up a trust to have his estate go to me when he passes. He's 70 and in good shape so I expect him to live another 20+ years. 

He owns a home worth $1m which he says I will probably just have to sell. He also just sold his 2nd home that he never goes to anymore for around $600k. The only money I get from him currently is $500 a month which he graciously give me. Also he said he will ""buy"" me a home in the next few years (likely from the money from the sale of his home he just sold). The house will be in his name and in the trust  but I would pick what house I want and he would pay property taxes and insurances on it and such. 

Also coincidently on my other side of my family, my grandma owns apartment buildings which generate 10k/month which will go to my dad and then to me. 

My uncle jokes that I will be a rich old man  All of this will probably not come until I am maybe 60 years old. Should I do anything differently regarding my life or savings now? I make about 80,000 with about 100,000 in net worth now including 401k and such.

personalfinance,Found a pretty big loophole at Wells Fargo,"I have a WF Visa which I pay off each month via auto-pay. My latest statement (September 1st) showed an $1100 balance, which is what I'd expect to be auto-paid on October 2nd.

Over the course of September, I had another $500 in charges, giving me a balance of $1600, right?

In the past few days, a vendor mistakenly charged my card $400, and then immediately corrected it with a $400 credit. Balance is still $1600, including the $1100 carried over from the prior period.

Yesterday (on the closing and auto-payment date) they withdrew $700, leaving a balance of $900. I called to make sure they weren't going to be charging me fees or interest on the $400 under-payment. They said that since a credit was received during the month, they apply that credit as a payment and only withdraw the difference.

Me: ""Couldn't I just keep charging stuff and then returning it, and never make an actual payment on the amount truly owed, and never pay any interest?""

WF rep: ""I suppose so. A payment is a payment, no matter how it happens.""

Does this strike anybody else as crazy? Isn't it providing a really low-effort means of ensuring an interest-free loan with no effective end-date?",1727971466.0,0,6,1fvbbzx

personalfinance,Company is Dissolving Pension &amp; Starting an ESPP,"Late last year my company announced they are dissolving our Pension Plan. They will be paying out the remainder of 2024 and I have already been talking to a friend, who’s a financial advisor/wealth management, about transferring it to them.
Today they announced an ESPP with 15% discount. Requires a 6 month hold in a Merrill Lynch account before I can transfer out.

Can I transfer my pension to the ESPP to reap the 15% or will I be penalized for doing so?
Obviously, haven’t spoken to my friend about this yet.

My total pension value is right at the max allowable ESPP yearly limit so in the grand scheme of this - if I do get penalized/taxed for doing so I could recoup some of those loses by transferring it to the ESPP at the discounted rate. My thought is since my company is decently large (17000+ employees worldwide &amp; $4.3B in revenue 2023) and this is new, that many employees will hop on the ESPP which could bump up the stock price even further recouping more of my loses.

I’d greatly appreciate any help or advice you can offer!

I've been with my current company for almost 8 years, and in that time, we've grown our staff by nearly 200%. Personally, I generate about $2.5 million in revenue for the company each year. Over the years, my responsibilities have significantly increased, and while the company is now recognizing my contributions, it's long overdue.

Below are the key changes being offered, followed by what I’d like to request, though I find it difficult to articulate in these situations.

1. **Base Salary Increase**: They’re offering a $10k increase, bringing my base from $75k to $85k. However, they’re eliminating my $10k annual bonus, which I’ve consistently earned, so this doesn’t feel like a true increase.
2. **Commission Structure**: I used to earn a flat 1% commission, but now I’ll be eligible for up to 3%—provided I hit a 20% growth target. This target has become more challenging to achieve as the years go on.
3. **Reporting Change**: I will be reporting to a different person, which is a positive change.
4. **Work-from-Office Requirement**: They’re moving from 3 days in the office to 5 days, which would significantly impact my work-life balance. I have two kids, and working from home helps me manage household tasks like cooking and laundry. I plan to counter this with a request for 4 days in the office instead.

personalfinance,"Seeking Advice on Handling Deceased Father's Car Loan and Repossession Issues
","Hey everyone, I could really use some advice on a complicated situation regarding my late father's car.

My father recently passed away, and since he had a low net worth, I handled his affairs using a small estate affidavit. One of the issues I've been struggling with is what to do about his car, which has an outstanding loan with Capital One.

The car is worth about $20,000, but I don’t want to take over the loan myself, and I also don't want the car. I’ve tried contacting Capital One multiple times to surrender the car or arrange for them to repossess it, but they’ve been unresponsive or unwilling to take it back due to a titling issue that can't be fixed. I can't keep the car at home, and I don’t want to assume the loan or have any liability for it. There was also an issue with the title — I can’t get a duplicate without already being on it, which I am not.

I’ve tried several things:

* Providing Capital One with my father’s death certificate and other documents to show that I'm handling his affairs and trying to surrender the car.
* Explaining that there’s no estate, only a small estate affidavit and that I don't want to take on ownership or responsibility for the debt.

The title issue is also a big barrier. Capital One won't seem to accept the car voluntarily unless it’s in my name, but I am unsure about transferring the title to my name, as I don't know if that will make me legally responsible for the debt. I’m now stuck with the car and no clear way to get them to take it back.

I am also worried about if I transfer it to my name and voluntarily repossess it if that will show up on my credit report and look bad. I’ve considered consulting a probate attorney, but the cost could be a concern. I'm just acting on behalf of my father's affairs and don’t want to end up responsible for the loan.

Has anyone dealt with anything similar? Should I keep pushing Capital One, try a different route, or just leave the car somewhere and let them know where it is for them to pick up whenever they want to if they decide to? I’d love any advice on what my next steps should be to get this resolved.",1727957405.0,1,4,1fv665b

personalfinance,What is the best thing to do about a broken down car that you still owe money on?,"I have a 2013 chevy that likely blew a head gasket and is leaking coolant into the engine. It was confirmed that it's burning coolant. I try not to drive the car but I do every 2 weeks for groceries and laundry. I have to put coolant into it every time I drive it or else it shakes like a salt shaker. I took it to a dealership and the head mechanic said it would cost more to fix it than its worth. I don't have $1000s. So I guess I just have to let this car die while paying $400/month on it. Yes. I was scammed. I didn't know any better. I got the car last year because I was desperate not to take the bus in winter. One of the biggest regrets on my financial life.  
  
I called a Toyota Direct about rolling the car into a lease for another used, old car. The salesman said that with so much negative equity on the car, it would have to be rolled into a NEW car and I would have to put $7000 down. Again, I don't have that much money and I don't know when I will. 

So what are my options? I NEED a car. It's not a luxury for me, its a necessity. Nowhere I need to go is within walking distance and the nearest bus stop is a 20 minute walk. I can't do that in winter. We get bad blizzards and I can't call off work for bad weather.

1) Apply for some kind of loan or SnapFinance to pay off these expensive repairs? (not likely since my credit is 500)

2) I did see a car on Toyota Direct for $200/month and $9000 total. What if I paid for both cars? That would drain me financially. But I would have a car and $9000 is less than the equity on my current useless car so I could pay off the ""new"" car sooner.  
  
3) Scrap the car for $1000 and try to take what little savings I can to buy a car outright? But I would still have to pay off the car. And Facebook Marketplace/Craigslist cars are so unpredictable, the car might break down in a week. Leaving me with -$1000s and no wheels at all.

4) Any other options?

Please no judging or insulting. I get that there is a lot that I don't know. I'm trying to learn the best I can.

\*\*\*TL:DR:\*\*\* Financed car pretty much broken down. Don't know if I should try to fix it, try to finance a new car or try to buy a car out right online.",1727929679.0,1,0,1fuzoxo
personalfinance,Family member owes the FTB back taxes and has no income other than social security. ,"My sister is physically disabled (cannot walk and in a wheelchair) and is in her mid 60’s. She has been disabled her entire life. She has had good jobs most of her life making decent money.  However, she spent the money as fast as she made it. She has nothing. She is now on social security in a HCL area in California. 

She makes $2800 a month on social security.  She is on a waiting list for a low income senior apartment. Over the summer, I found out the FTB said she owes them $100k in back taxes. Long story short, she sold a house six years ago and when she filed her taxes did them incorrectly. Apparently, there was a form that she didn’t include. She moved multiple times since then and no longer had any of her tax records. She filed correctly with the IRS, but because it is over three years they will not give her a copy of her taxes to show the FTB. She didn’t tell me any of this when it was happening. She hired an attorney that would take payments (after the FTB took everything in her bank account). 

I found out last night that she looked into filing an Offer of Compromise with FTB but she would need $15,000. As she doesn’t have any assets, her attorney filed a one year deferment. She can keep her social security check without it being garnished. However, this is just kicking the can down the road for a year. I asked her last night how much her attorney is costing. She didn’t answer. I think it could be $8k.

I have been giving her $500-600 a month for food. My question is what should I do?  I don’t trust that she will continue filing the deferment with FTB. She consistently makes very poor choices. When a problem happens she just ignores it. If she were not disabled, I would not be so stressed. However, the reality is I will need to help her to keep her from being homeless. I’m not rolling in money. I have a decent job and a small house (not paid off yet). I am careful with my money and have some savings. 

I just need advice from someone that is an outsider. Do I give her $15k and hope the FTB accepts the offer? Do we just file a yearly deferment every year?

I immediately contact them with the insurance information, death certificates, and proof as the executor, the goal being to get the insurance in my name accepted, or the loan transferred into my name. 

It's been 10 months of me calling, sending in paperwork, getting shuffled to different people, and told the previous stuff I filled out doesn't actually work. Telling me they'll call me back, but never do. I've called them over 50 times, and sent dozens of emails. 

Finally, this week after talking with a higher up about getting the new insurance accepted, and the lost money refunded, she notified me that a different company has taken on my loan, so there is nothing more she can do, and that I should notify said new company. 

What would you do next? 
Is there anyway to get this money back, or get this resolved quickly?

personalfinance,Recovering from serious illness - how to manage credit score?,"I recently recovered from a long term debilitating illness that occurred just before covid struck.

When I thought I was so unwell that I would never re-join the workforce, my finances went downhill. I did what was needed to keep the lights on and tried to cover the bills as best as I could, but I often went into my overdraft. I know I have a poor credit score. 

When I went back to work, I took out a credit card to help build my credit score, but I hate them. I tend to forget that I have put a purchase on them and then I will forget to pay the monthly bill and get a reminder from the bank/fine. I feel like I would be 100 % better off without access to one. I hate owing money, as it took me ages to clear my overdraft built up during my illness. I now have an account with no overdraft and I love it. 

Do I really have to have a credit card in order to build a credit rating? How important will credit be going forward? Would it be better to setup an auto payment and just put one monthly expense on the thing?  I own 9/10 of my house ( I think we have about 50k left on the mortgage) and I have no borrowings or debts of any kind anymore. I just want to deal with the money coming in from my pay check, have no access to an overdraft etc. I prefer to keep things as simple as possible.

personalfinance,How do I save for the future when I work part time?,"I’m 27 years old and have no idea where to start with my finances. I live with my dad rent free and have 2 useless college degrees but no college debt thankfully. The only debt I have is medical around 5k (4k is an insurance mistake that I am still arguing). I’ve only worked part time jobs that made minimum wage. I work 2 part time jobs rn, one is only 5 hours a month and the other is 10-15 hours a week. I pay for my own car loan and maintenance but my dad pays for the insurance. I’ll occasionally have to go out and spend money on food but other than that I don’t have any other payments. I haven’t checked my credit since I got the car loan and I’ve only been late on one payment (the first one cuz I didn’t know what date it was due). I don’t have a credit card either.

I just started my second part time job a couple weeks ago and really want to start saving for the future. I might have to start paying my dad rent next year so I’m planning on taking compTIA classes to get certificates and hopefully a better job. I’m also looking into starting a small business to sell 3D printed objects I designed. So I have ideas to make more money but don’t know what to do with the money to prepare for the future. Like I know I should open a savings (I only have a checking) but I also heard some banks are better than others so what am I supposed to look for? And I don’t know anything about investing or if I should invest. Where should I start? 

EDIT: I know I should get a full time job, I’m working on it. I have connections that can help me get a job once I get the compTIA certifications. My degrees are Electrical Engineering and Physics, those fields (at least in my area) require a bachelors or experience. Most full time jobs in my area want bachelors, experience or are labor intensive. I’m being tested for fibromyalgia and have ADHD. Honestly, working a 9-5 sounds dreadful but I know I’ll have to bite the bullet. Long term, I hope I can either grow my small business or make money by doing something creative but that’s way down the line.

personalfinance,More to 401k or buy a second house?,"48 years old.  Can retire at 55 and collect a decent pension.  Pension alone isn't enough to live on.  I would work part time until probably 62, at which point I would start SS and my 401k.

My 401k is six figures but not by much.  If I had to ballpark it, I'm going to have $250k minimum in it by the time I retire.  I only do the minimum to get the match.  My employer also does a large annual match on their own.

My income has gone up.  My debt and what not has gone down.  I have a small modest townhouse with 2.5% mortgage and about $225k equity.

I won't retire where I currently live.  Hate winters.  I'm planning to move to a beach community.  I've considered getting a second mortgage now, which I can qualify for, and buying a second home.  Rent it out either as a regular rental or an airbnb in an effort to hopefully break even on it.  Seven years from now when I retire, it would be my home.  Conversely, given the equity I have in my home now, and considering my area is 'hot' and prices continue to rise, if I were to wait until 55 and sell my current place - I would easily have over $300k in cash for a new purchase.  I would get something small - likely a 2-3BR condo.  Looking at a few areas.  Some $300k could currently buy a condo outright.  Otherwise - not so much; would still need a mortgage.

The alternative - really start cranking my 401k distributions up.  Get a mortgage at 55.  Possibly no mortgage given I could access the equity from selling my townhouse.  My concern - house prices continue to rise over the next several years.  Who knows where interest rates will be.

Thoughts?

personalfinance,"Small, inexpensive whole-life insurance policy - keep paying or cash out?","I know the general feeling on whole life insurance policies, but most times when this topic is brought up, it's expensive and high value insurance policies that are purchased less as insurance and more as an investment vehicle. I have a different twist on this question.

Back when I was just getting started in my career, my parents had me get a small $25k face value whole life insurance policy, with the idea that it would be just enough cover basic end-of-life expenses like funeral, burial, and the like. In other words - buying insurance to be insurance, not as an investment.

However, 25 years have passed since then. I have no kids and no spouse, and nothing is likely to change on either of those aspects. My only sibling is named as a beneficiary on my HYSA and investment accounts (taxable and tax-exempt retirement), which absolutely dwarf this small insurance policy, so I feel pretty protected in the event of my death anyway. Besides, I don't particularly want a funeral if I die, so I would just need a basic burial or cremation.

The current death benefit is up to $27k, the surrender value is $5500, and the annual premium is $230. The only argument I can come up with for continuing to pay is ""it's cheap insurance"" because $230 a year is really affordable... but even still, something would have to happen to all of my other funds for that to be really needed.

personalfinance,Need advice about home equity loan + debt consolidation ,"I'm 22, and made some very stupid decisions when I was 19 and got myself into a fair amount of \*manageable\* debt. I took out a couple personal loans and racked up my credit cards after breaking my leg and becoming unemployed since I was an electrician and it's hard to climb ladders with a shattered knee. I own a home and the past 2 years of being here the basement gets water in it when it rains, which has been kind of a non-issue since there are drains, but it got really bad one time and I had standing water. Blah blah blah more history I need to install a sump pump, which got quoted at 6k + whatever mold remediation is going to cost. The problem is that I'm too busy paying off high interest debt so I can't afford to pay that out of pocket for at LEAST another 18 months when everything gets paid off. Here's the cost breakdown right now:

Personal loan: $225 @ 36% APR, currently paying double on it so $450 | 36 more months at standard payment

Personal loan: $85 @ 12% APR | 28 more months

Credit Card: $150 @ 24% APR | forever

Car Loan: $150 @ 0% loan is through family. | 14 months left

Medical Debt Collections: $75 @ idk apr probably zero I hope. | forever

That comes out to about 910 +/- 50 for credit cards that aren't used often. Which is manageable right now. I got approved for a home equity loan for 25k @ 11.65% APR with a $551 payment for 60 months, figure if I go through with that I could pay 900 a month towards it to help pay it off in \~36 months

TL;DR  The question here is does it makes sense to fix my house + consolidate all my debt into this one loan with a lower interest rate and pay it for longer, or to pay everything else off in the next 18 months AND THEN go and fix my house?

personalfinance,Used vs New(ish) cars,"I've been reading up on alot of people encourage others to buy old/used car. I'm genuinely curious as to why that is. In 2012-2019 I bought a 2004 Honda Civic (at that time it had like ~~80k~~ 130k miles on it) and drove that cute bug approximately 400 miles a week till the wheels fell off (the engine stopped working one fateful Christmas Day). The problem was that after the first 8 months or so of driving it, I was shelling out close to 600 bucks around every 6 months on repairs on the aged out parts and as the years went by it was close to 1000 on some of the bigger more expensive parts, also this is not including oil maintenance. Now, for people who are into cars and don't mind spending  their weekend to work on these parts themselves, that's great, this might look like a good option for them it'll be probably cheaper even since they'll be cutting labor cost, but for me? Absolutely not! I just needed the car to get me from point A to point B, get my oil and tires maintenance and be on my way.  
I did eventually finance for a new(ish) car, and let me tell you, after 5 years, close to 9k miles a year (I've moved), I'm spending about 140 for oil maintenance a year and replacing or patching the occasional flat tire that occurs after driving in sketchy parts of town.

personalfinance,22 yo software engineer: work as full time state government employee or consultant for the state govt?,"Hi guys,

I just graduated college, 22M, and have a software engineering position at a state government agency. I was given two options: (1) join as full time government employee with benefits or (2) join as a contractor with higher pay but less benefits. 

I chose W2 contractor (hired under a staffing agency). The salary is $82k and the benefits are 12 days PTO (must accrue 1 per month) along with 10 paid holidays. The state government job gets 14 holidays, and I must follow their schedule since they are my client. Any additional holidays past 10 are deducted from my PTO so I really get barely any personal time. Also, If I stay another 2-3 years as consultant, my boss verbally told me I can get raises up to 100k+ contrary to the government position. 

BTW, when i say “boss” it is the department head of the state agency i work at. Not the consulting company. 

However, I am now starting to regret my decision. The government position offers this: $65-70k salary, benefits are 4 weeks PTO, 3 weeks sick leave, pension, and 1 week personal leave, along with 14 paid holidays, free tolls, union membership, and tuition reimbursement. The time off is insane. 

I talked to my boss and I am able to switch to full time employee, but he strongly advised against it due to the fact that the pay is much lower and i will get raises at a much slower rate than as a consultant. However, there is job security and its union. Salaries are determined by the union, raises are about 3% per year and everyone gets paid the same. 

If I do calculations properly, the government job with all the benefits is around $85.1k. The consultant job with benefits is $88k. 

My boss knows I want to switch to government employee. He asked me to compute the benefits worth of the government position and add it to my consultant salary and come back to him with a number. That comes to around $93k. So I can ask for $93k salary as consultant (which may be too high so he might say no) or switch to government employee for lower pay but much better benefits. He said I can take unpaid time off for 4 weeks to match the government position, but I’d be losing money, however it’d still bring me above the government pay. 

Regardless my boss keeps advising me not to stay here long term because it’s government and the private sector pays more. He says my skills are high but the pay doesn’t match. I’m really not sure what’s going on here and what his motives are

I like the high salary, but the benefits are just so bad as a consultant. If I get sick or need to miss a day I basically lose out on vacation time. And the PTO accrual rate is very low. How important should benefits be at my young age?

What would you guys say is the best route? Stay with contractor and ask for higher pay due to lost benefits, or go to government employee? Keep in mind I am young and do not have bills to pay, all money is mine. I am not sure if I would be screwing myself over if I go with government position because the pay is lower.

personalfinance,Alternative minimum tax and ISOs - When to buy stock options in tech,"Hello fellow start up people. Just a fair warning about AMT (alternative minimum tax) for those who work in the tech space.

If your startup has given you stock options that you're planning on exercising...first of all congrats on being a part owner and/or your successful exit! You may not be aware though that by exercising your options there could be tax implications. Wanted to cover this briefly as, I see these questions a lot.

I highly recommend talking with your tax pro about when to execute your stock options, because they make it way too easy on Carta to do that without even thinking about it. Because even if you don't sell the stock, you're possibly opening yourself up to higher taxes.

The Alternative Minimum Tax exists because high earners (and even some middle-class folks) still have to pay taxes even if they have a ton of deductions. And if you execute stock options, the IRS can see that as income because of the difference in the value between what you bought the stocks for and what they're worth, pushing you into that higher tax threshold where the AMT kicks in. And it's not optional if it applies to you, you have to pay it instead of your regular tax.

**TLDR** Make sure you talk to some tax pro before you execute.  The TLDR is that you should talk to your accountant about when to execute, but mine recommended only exercising my stock options after I was out of work, that way I would have a lower total income and not reach the lower threshold to trigger the AMT. Varies depending on the situation! Just wanted to give everybody the heads-up

It’s states that I need to respond by October 22nd or else they will assume it is my debt.

1. Ignore and wait until I get an official summons?
2. Respond asking for proof that it is in fact my debt?
3. Call and ask to work out a payment plan?

My fear is if I respond will that start the statute over? What if I ask for a payment plan but I can’t afford it? Can I try to settle and still have a payment plan?

personalfinance,"Confusing medical debt, collectors claim I owe $7k for a procedure I received 3 years ago that the hospital never billed me directly for","Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

Context: I live in Pennsylvania. 3 years ago (2021), I had an unwanted pregnancy with my fiance (for so many reasons, a major one being that I was a broke college student and neither of us could afford a child) and had an abortion. I was only 7 weeks along at the time of the procedure, so thankfully I was able to just get the pills. 

  
Back then, I was still on my dad's health insurance. The day I got the procedure done, I explicitly asked the front desk receptionist at the hospital if I had a bill I needed to pay. She clicked around on her computer a bit, confirmed my insurance, and then told me that my procedure would be covered by my insurance. I was shocked by this, because I did not expect any health insurance to cover an abortion - so I asked her multiple times ""Are you sure? It is 100% covered?"" and she kept saying yes, you're good, yes. So I got the pill, and I thought the hospital would just contact me directly if I did end up needing to cover some portion of the expense.

Fast-forward to last year (2023): By then I got hired full-time by my company with benefits(in 2022), so I had my new health insurance through my company + my dad's since he didn't remove me from his plan yet. I never got anything from the hospital on my account in their app nor via email/mail about any outstanding bills I owe for that procedure in 2021. I received a call from someone who said they represent a company hired by the hospital to sort out medical bills, and she told me that there was some confusion between my insurance companies regarding the coverage of my procedure from 2021. She needed to confirm with me on what exact date I gained my new coverage through my company, so that they could sort out who was responsible for covering my bill for that procedure. So I did, I gave her all of the information for both of my health insurances, the dates I got them &amp; everything. I asked her if I owed anything, and she said no I don't, she just needed to confirm with me the dates to settle things between the insurance companies.

Fast-forward again to this year (2024). In February I received a letter from a debt collector saying that I owe $7000 to the hospital. It said that I could write to them by April to dispute the debt, otherwise they'd assume the information was correct. At the time, I ignored it because I thought it was a scam - The amount seemed completely outrageous, and I had checked through my online account with that hospital on their app &amp; did not see any outstanding bills or balance I had with them.

Then, today, I just received a letter from a DIFFERENT debt collector company saying the same thing: That I owe this hospital $7k, and I can write to them by November to dispute it. 

I am so confused. There's no way that the abortion pill could've cost that much?? I looked it up, and in PA generally the cost of an abortion-by-pill procedure is no more than $700?? My credit hasn't gone down at all (yet), it has been at 780+ for the past several months... 

Anyone have any idea what happened here? What do I do? Should I call the hospital? Should I ignore it? What happens if I write back &amp; dispute it? I'm already in so much student loan debt, I'm really panicking a bit. Any advice would be seriously appreciated.",1727905093.0,1,0,1furu4l

personalfinance,Finance app suggestions ,"Best App to Manage Bills and Financial Goals, Suggestions?

Last night I came across a post about a finance app called William bills, but it has disappeared or maybe just got buried down the feed. With the cost of living skyrocketing and trying to save for a home deposit I've had to keep a closer eye on my finances. I've been using the premium version of WeMoney for the past year, and while it’s been okay for organizing things, it feels limited, and the bugs get frustrating, especially since it costs $10 a month. The automation is decent, but I'm looking for something more reliable and more features.
Before WeMoney, I was using Excel spreadsheets, manually importing my bank statements, categorizing expenses, and setting up budgets. It would take me well over an hour each week to do everything manually. 
Now I’ve tried this William Bills app last night and this morning, and it’s pretty cool. I uploaded a PDF bill from AGL and a pool maintenance invoice and it imported all the details for me which was pretty cool. I've also tried Frollo before Wemoney, but it kept on freezing on my Samsung S23, which sucked because I wanted to compare it with other apps. 
Does anyone use any other apps or desktop software that help manage bills, track subscriptions, categorize expenses, and set financial goals? I also use Splitwise to split bills with my housemates. I found an app called Mint on Google with heaps of great reviews but it doesn’t seem to be available in the app stores anymore in Australia. I’m willing to pay $10-$15 a month for something automatic, user-friendly, and that will help me save towards a home deposit over the next 2 years. Suggestions?

personalfinance,"Moving out (possibly) at 19, need some advice on whether it’s the right decision or not.","Need some advice about what to do here

Hi there.

So, I’m 19, I’m a software engineer apprentice apprentice with about 4 months left on my apprenticeship (I keep the job after, just more money). 

I’m currently very stable and am living with my parents.

Monthly Expenses:

each month I spend about £220 ish on train tickets

Maybe like £50 on food

£500 on ETFs and general investments 

£100 in rent 

Probably like £50 every 2 months in petrol since I don’t drive too much. 

This isn’t an expense but I also have an emergency fund in a cash ISA with about £1000 in it. 


So, my good friend of nearly 9 years has just been gifted a house by his parents and asked me if I wanted to move in with him. 

The rent would be about £350 per month. 

Things that will change if I take this:

I’ll be paying an extra £250 in rent

I’ll have some sort of independence

I’ll be spending a bit more on food

I won’t be buying train tickets anymore since I’d be driving to work instead, increasing my car expenses to probably about £150 a month including car insurance too, as at the moment I have yearly insurance which is running out soon so it’ll be moving to monthly payments. 

So, my new monthly expenses would look like this:

Rent: 350

Train: 0

Food: 120 ish

Car payments: 130 maybe (insurance and petrol)

Investments: 500

General expenses like cleaning products, general house supplies: 50


However this wouldn’t leave me with too much. And suddenly being pretty financially comfortable would lead to living a bit on the edge.. so, maybe a take away 150 ish from investments each month until I get my pay rise in a few months? 

Just to add, I also have no debt, and have a pretty respectable credit score I suppose. 

Any advice would be really appreciated on whether I should do this or not. But honestly I think it helped me a lot to just actually right it down lol. 

Thanks in advance

While the short term can still be volatile and could see a decline, they point out the following 3 things that bode well for equities:

1. Earnings growth continues to remain strong and as the cost to borrow $ goes down, that should help companies boost growth even more

2. Historically, the gap we currently have between where the Fed rate is at vs current inflation levels has correlated with an average of 14% returns— this is based on data starting in 1962.

3. The combination of rates falling with an acceleration of Leading Economic indicators and an increase is Bank’s willingness to lend (which are all occurring) has also lead to an average of +17% and +15% returns, respectively

I wanted to share some growing concerns around Applovin (APP) that I believe retail investors should be aware of, especially in light of ongoing insider activity and legal investigations.

Applovin reported strong revenue of $1.08 billion for Q2 2024, with $446 million in free cash flow, which seems impressive. However, things aren’t as rosy as they seem. Here’s why:

1. Insider Sell-offs: Major insider sales have been happening around key price milestones and vesting periods. For example, recent filings show sales of millions of dollars worth of shares, raising red flags about insider confidence.

2. Legal Investigations: The company is facing lawsuits like Mitchell vs. Applovin, where allegations of fiduciary breaches and misleading statements are being raised. This lawsuit, along with others, could significantly impact investor confidence and stock value moving forward.

3. Concentrated Ownership: A large portion of Applovin is controlled by hedge funds, index funds, and insiders, which could suggest a misalignment with retail investors’ interests. Is the PR push we’re seeing just a way to offload shares onto retail investors?

Despite their revenue growth, Applovin’s core business in mobile gaming is slowing, and their expansion into e-commerce is still in the pilot phase with real revenue contributions not expected until 2025.

What are your thoughts? Are these legitimate concerns, or do you see this as a temporary overreaction? I’d love to hear your insights, especially from anyone who has been tracking insider sales or following the lawsuits.

Feel free to share this with any press contacts, as I believe the broader investing community should be aware of these concerns.

investing,Autocratic Regimes overstating their GDP Figures,"Are Autocratic regimes overstating their GDP figures? There is some strong evidence that this is the case.

[This study published in 2022 by Luiz Martinez](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/720458?journalCode=jpe) investigates the extent to which different political regimes inflate reported GDP growth, using night-time light (NTL) data as a proxy for economic growth and a tool for detecting how they align with reported GDP figures in both democratic and autocratic regimes. Night-time light data, collected from satellites, provides a consistent and objective measure of economic activity that contrasts with self-reported GDP figures, which are susceptible to manipulation. The paper examines how the elasticity of GDP relative to NTL varies across political regimes, focusing on the differences between autocracies and democracies.

The analysis uses a dataset of 184 countries over the past two decades. The core finding is a robust ""autocracy gradient"" in the elasticity of GDP with respect to NTL.  The study finds that the relationship between NTL and GDP growth is stronger in autocratic regimes than in democratic ones. This suggests that authoritarian governments are more likely to overstate their economic growth, exaggerating reported GDP figures by approximately 35% compared to democracies.
The paper performs a myriad of robustness checks to make sure that their findings are controlling for other factors that might influence NTL growth. These checks include the following.


- Economic Structure: Analyzing the impact of different components of GDP, such as government spending and sectoral composition, to ensure that the elasticity is not skewed by the economic structure of autocracies.

- NTL Characteristics: Adjusting for measurement errors in NTL data, including the share of unlit or top-coded cells and the spatial concentration of NTL, to ensure the robustness of the results.

- Economic Development: Assessing the impact of population size, urbanization, access to electricity, and initial GDP levels to rule out the influence of cross-country economic development differences.

- Statistical Capacity: Examining whether variations in statistical capacity or corruption might explain the discrepancies in GDP reporting

The study also tries to calculate just exaggeration rates of autocratic regimes in order to get a more accurate figure. The deflator is calculated by estimating the GDP exaggeration rate for each country using its average FiW index and NTL data. This adjusted rate is then used to correct reported GDP figures for overstatements. By applying the estimated GDP exaggeration rates, the study recalculates long-run growth rates for countries and finds that the relative performance of autocracies versus democracies changes. The adjusted figures show that not-free, partially free, and free countries have similar growth rates when accounting for manipulation, challenging the previously perceived economic success of autocratic regimes. Although these adjustments are very rough around the edges, even the author admits this. 

To me this has a ton of implications for China. Many Americans fear China’s exceptionalism, but the paper implies the following. 

To me this has a ton of implications for China. Many Americans fear China’s exceptionalism, but the paper implies the following. 
China’s economy is reported to be roughly $18.5 trillion USD, whereas the US Economy is roughly $28.7 trillion USD. That makes China’s economy roughly 64% the size of the US’s economy. When applying the deflator on China that makes their GDP actually roughly $13.7 trillion USD, or 47.7% the size of the US’s economy.

I'm wondering if there might be a less common asset category that I could swap out for small cap growth in my portfolio, either something that will track the performance of a small-cap growth index or just something that has similar qualities as an asset. I admit I am also a little curious why this particular category isn't represented in sustainable funds, when every other major category is. 

I'm mot really interested in discussing the value of sustainable investing here - it's just something I'm messing around with in this one account - so even if you're not a fan, I still think it's neat to ask the hypothetical question of ""is there anything I could use to replace this category?""",1726417441.0,13,9,1fhghup

investing,Never ending Bull-Market?,"Hey everyone,

I've been closely following the current economic indicators and I'm puzzled by the S&amp;P 500 reaching new all-time highs. I broke up my logic into individual points:

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Forecasts indicate that inflation remains stubbornly high. High inflation typically reduces consumer purchasing power and can squeeze corporate profit margins, which university theory says that these should pressure stock prices downward. Is this no longer the case?




The Federal Reserve has as we all know raised interest rates to combat inflation the past year or so. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, which slow economic growth and make equities less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Now this often isn't reflected in financial statements right away, it takes time for the effects of interest rates to effect the bottomline. You don't really notice until you start paying the cumulative interest.




Wall Street has been saying there's a 50% chance of a 0.5 rate cut pricing it into the market if the Fed decides to pause or reverse its tightening measures. If the Fed doesn’t act as expected, this uncertainty could lead to a tremendous oopsie daisy that no one seems to be talking about. When has the Fed acted in the interest of the equities market? They work for the government.




Youth unemployment rates ain't looking so good and there's a rising sense of generational hopelessness present in pop culture and everyday narratives.High youth unemployment can lead to reduced consumer spending which is pretty surface level, but on a large scale, doesn't this also lead to a reduced savings rate, less investments and therefore less money flowing into companies who need to maintain a large price



Now obviously these are a few off the top of my head examples pointing to the negative so I'm asking you to offer a counter-argument.


Why do YOU believe the S&amp;P 500 is continuing to climb to new heights?

Are strong corporate earnings or future growth expectations counterbalancing these negative factors?

Are there international developments or global market trends supporting the S&amp;P 500's rise?

Is the anticipation of future rate cuts fueling buying behavior now?

investing,What will the stock market do if ai creates growth in businesses but also makes lots of people lose their jobs due to automation?,"I know nobody has a crystal ball and no one can predict the stock market or the development of AI, but there are some who genuinely believe that AI is going to make A LOT of human jobs not workable in the future and instead these jobs will be done by machines. 

My question is, what would happen to the stock market in this scenario? If AI increases productivity and profit margins for pretty much all of its businesses, if it really is that powerful, but the workforce goes down to 20% unemployment for example which is around what it was during the Great Depression, what would happen to the stock market? On one hand you’ve got huge organisations growing which would make those stocks go up in value normally, but without millions of people putting money in via their pension, 401k etc or simply through retail investing because they no longer have a job, what do people think will happen to the stock market?

I am nearing retirement age and want to set up my investments so I can have a chunk that is diversified to bonds, treasuries, hysa, and / or cd ladder component.  NOTE:  I am totally *NOT* asking for advice on stocks, index funds, or dividend investments, I understand that and am good with that part!

(Obviously, HYSA and CD are not hard to understand conceptually, but maybe hard to understand the value vs bonds/treasuries.)  With interest rates about to go down to a degree as another factor...I want to have some liquidity and safety.

I am totally lost on the bonds or treasuries options and strategies though.  They seem like a hassle, and maybe an outdated strategy.  Everything I research leaves me just as confused tbh.  I do have both RothIRA and conventional investment account with broker.

So:

1. What is the argument FOR INVESTING in either **Individual Bonds** or **Treasury Funds** in lieu of CDs or HYSA?  All seem relatively ""safe"" are presumably insured and have some interest rate risk.
2. What is the argument against HYSA or CD ladder (aside from interest rates about to fall)?

investing,"Inherited IRA invested in Disney, do I sell?","I'll be honest, my personal IRA is just in index funds, currently PRWAX, since it's at TRowe. I know enough about investing to be dangerous (to myself), but I'm definitely no expert.

Last year I inherited my mom's IRA that is pretty much invested into specific stocks. Most of them are relatively safe and doing ok. Some have done really well in the past, like medical startups, but I don't know enough about them to know if they will continue that rise.

But the worst performer has, for obvious reasons, been DIS. The account has 750 shares with a cost basis of $114.

I've got to believe they'll eventually rebound, but that seems far off in the future. My gut says that unless they somehow miraculously rebounded within the next year, I'd get better gains by just selling DIS and moving to a fidelity index, like FXAIX or something. 

The bottom line being that I don't want to withdrawal from this account until I have to. I'm taking out more than the minimum each year to fund my own IRA and my wife's, but otherwise I'm trying not to touch this since it's 10 years of tax free gains. Which also means I'd like to make the most of those 10 years.

Honestly part of me is tempted to sell all the individual stocks and put them into an index fund.

Long time listener, first time caller kinda thing ha ha. I have been putting money into investments for a little while now and have always wondered if I have done things correctly. Firm believer of just because it works doesnt mean it cannot be better.

  
So a little bit about me. From Australia. Male 39 yrs old. Combined household income of around 120k before tax. Currently have around 10k in saving, about 10k invested into Crypto (spread over 3) and about 10k into ETF's (currently 2) I plan on not investing any more into Crypto but plan on continuing to invest into ETF's

  
My 2 current ETFs are VAS and IVV with a rough 50/50 split. Is this a smart thing to do or is there better performing funds I should be looking into that will be more beneficial for me.  My plan is not to keep selling and buying constantly but more of a HODL approach.

  
I have read advice online people are recommending at least 3 ETF's but I am unsure what the 3rd one should be. I am currently investing 100$ per week but dont know if I need to try to ramp this up or if its ok what I am doing.

  
Would love to hear some advice from the experts.

investing,Does anyone have a clue as to how Alpha Architect will document the Aug 14 distribution of its ETF named BOXX?,"My broker, Schwab, just says that it is a distribution with a certain amount as short-term gain, and the other as long-term gain.  OK, that's great, but the only thing that matters is how this will be conveyed to the IRS, but I can't figure out how this is to be done.  If I look at a 1099-DIV, there is box 2a, ""Total capital gain"", but my understanding is that that correlates to Schedule D, Line 13, and is thus treated entirely as long-term.  

Interestingly, there is a mention in the instructions for (year 2023) Schedule D, p. D-2, right column, ""Capital Gain Distributions"" that says:

&gt;These distributions are paid by a mutual fund (or other regulated investment company) or real estate investment trust from its net realized long-term capital gains. Distributions of net realized short-term capital gains aren't treated as capital gains. Instead, they are included on Form 1099-DIV as ordinary dividends.

So the question is, presuming that BOXX is going to document this as a distribution on the 1099-DIV, then wasn't it in effect being untruthful in converying to the brokerages that this distribution is an ordinary dividend, and not a short-term gain?  Investors might think that they will be able to balance this capital gain off of other capital losses, which they won't be able to do if it is ordinary dividend (yes, I know about the $3K allowable loss against regular income, but let's presume that that has already been used by the tax filer).

Of course, it could be that BOXX is going to document this in some other way, but I see nothing at the Alpha Architect website that has any mention of how this is going to be done.

Also I've played with wealthfront, robin hood, acorns, and might aggressive acorns account has $5k in it and has done best - I'm grandfathered in at $1/mo

Wealthfront has tax loss harvesting i guess but don't understand that really

Robin hood has let me build an aggressive portfolio and I'm using the 3% Roth Ira match incentive they offer

I've looked at the vanguard fidelity and schwab apps and their robot advisors but still not sure how to best compare them all. I assume it's best to not do the robo advisor if you are willing to do the index funds and set and forget it and cheaper in long run? Unless it isn't? :)

Worst case scenario there is great depression i lose all value and it takes 25 years to get it back - but best case scenario - it grows way better in market and in 5 years i move some out to hys emergency fund (or keep it growing if i can)

I know next 5 years aren't guaranteed to be like last 5 but i feel pressure to try and catch up.

I plan on asking a CFP also but just curious feedback from this group that might help me think of more intelligent questions to ask

Also I've played with wealthfront, robin hood, acorns, and might aggressive acorns account has $5k in it and has done best - I'm grandfathered in at $1/mo

Wealthfront has tax loss harvesting i guess but don't understand that really

Robin hood has let me build an aggressive portfolio and I'm using the 3% Roth Ira match incentive they offer

I've looked at the vanguard fidelity and schwab apps and their robot advisors but still not sure how to best compare them all. I assume it's best to not do the robo advisor if you are willing to do the index funds and set and forget it and cheaper in long run? Unless it isn't? :)

Feedback please on all this. Trying to play catch up.

investing,Value investing in (UK) life insurance companies,"If I'm not mistaken, comparing the book value of (UK) life insurance companies is not straightforwards and punished accounts are of limited use to this end.

Most insurers invest heavily in illiquid private assets which have no observable market value, so asset values will be spurious. Sure they can discount expected asset cashflows, but allowances for credit risk in these calculations will require expert judgment and will vary from company-to-company.

Similarly, liability values are based on assumptions which are not published (or at-least not with sufficient granularity and alongside the demographic make-up of liability portfolios to validate quoted liability values). If I can't compare the mortality assumptions, for example, made by 2 different companies then how can I compare the quoted values of their liabilities?

With such long-tailed assets and liabilities and no disclosure of assumptions or valuation approaches, how does one objectively compare the accounts of two life insurers? Obviously regulation such as IFRS17 \_should\_ make accounts comparable, but only to a limited extent since the level of prudence used by different insurers will vary.

  
I've stipulated that this question relates to UK life insurers because I have a vague understanding of how UK life insurers accounts are prepared - but the question may well relate to various types of insurance company in various countries for all I know.",1726239295.0,11,5,1ffwqk1

investing,Capital Group American Funds claims they HAVE and CAN beat the indexes…,"Here is the article: https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/pdf/shareholder/MFGEBR-097-619801.pdf

I have done my fair share of research into investing, different mutual funds, indexes and talked to a multitude of different financial advisors over the years. This Northwestern Mutual advisor (a friend sells insurance for them and offered a free meeting with one of their actual financial advisors, so I figured why not). Got in a long discussion about funds he believes in and why. He was preaching American Funds up and down. 

Not my first time hearing the American Funds speech, but he sent me this article by them outright stating they beat out the S&amp;P in the long term by QUITE A BIT. I was a bit taken back by it. Reading over the article multiple times I still don’t necessarily understand the article and the math behind it. It feels like Cheerios telling me breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Or Welch’s telling me a glass of juice will make me live longer. Just seems like they would skew an article like this any way they could to boost investments.

It is a long article and a lot to take in, but interesting nonetheless and would love to see some critiques by people smarter than me as to what they think.

In my opinion American Funds specifically the growth fund of America has done historically well. Especially navigating the dot com bubble which really helps skew their lifetime data on how it compares. Navigating other financial crises they have done relatively average. All while charging high front end loads and ER’s. But never would think that over the long term it would be that much better than the S&amp;P.

investing,Position transfer not complient with the Securities Trading Act ?,"Hi all !

On the 8th of August I required via email a transfer of positions from Trade Republic to Interactive Brokers.
They only recently got back with me (11th of September), telling me what I will sum up by ""we've been very busy sorry for the delay, but we're taking care of it now""

Okay then ! I replied asking if they had an estimation of how long it would take for the transfer to finally be executed.

Their answer, summed up :

- your demand has *now* been *treated*
- please understand it can take a few weeks
- you can read more about why in this article (which I can't link in this sub, it was a BaFin article)

Now what's interesting is that I actually went and read the article, which provided the following infos :

- According to the **Securities Trading Act (WpHG), article 69**, transfer orders must be executed ""immediatly and honnestly"". However this meant different things for companies and individuals, which led to an increase in complaints in 2020/2021

- Which then led to **article 63 of the WpHG** stating that these transfers must be executed within 3 weeks. If the company fails to do so for whatever reason, they have to inform the customer immediatly after this delay (within 5 business days after delay expiry)

- this was linked to a decision of Munich's superior tribunal, which considered that a company had ""failed in its obligations"" past this delay. **( OLG ) (19 U 1687/06)**

Now, in my case... Their last delay to notify me was on September 5th (accounting for the 5 business days period). They only sent me an email back on the 11th. On top of that, what I'm afraid is happening is that they are only processing this request now, which means I have to wait an extra ""few weeks"" (their terms), during which they told me it was critical not to sell my shares because it'd result in having to buy them back to cover the position etc.

What's annoying is that I was already frowning about these delays as the stock I'm transfering is very volatile and I believe could spike soon, which means I'd want to sell. But now, extra delay ?

So, I'm wondering if what I understood is correct, and if there's anything I can say/do in hopes of making this quicker, as they are not compliant with the regulations. Thanks so much for anyone who could light my lantern and help me with this, and have a great day !",1726169950.0,2,10,1ffbdez
investing,Update of paying off mortage vs investing in equities ,"not sure if any one remembers, I posted a post 2 months ago and asked if I shall invest in equities or pay off my 7.885% ARM mortgage.

here is what I did.

Following the end of june discussion, I invested all liquid cash into a bucket of stocks and took the risk of a market downturn.

I sold 2/3 of the mortgage amount of stocks around August 28th and realized some small gains about 0.8% gain and paid 2/3 of the mortagage balance. slightly beat the interest income i could earn from treasury account and had way more flexibility

My equities position currently has respectively 2% unrealized loss and 2.4% unrealized loss in 2 accounts.

my worst performing stocks are

1. crwd, and every one knows why..
2. qcom
3. Amat.

Conclusion:

It feels to me it’s actually worth the risk of investing in equities since market can easily beat the mortgage rate with the volatility in market.

I could have gained 8% if i would have sold crwd at the beginning of July…

investing," It’s easy to buy gold, how /where do I sell it?","A lot of people talk about how easy it is to buy gold—whether it’s from big retailers like Costco, online dealers, or even local shops. However, once you’ve accumulated gold bars or coins, the big question becomes: how do you sell it, and where?

For example, who buys gold from individuals like us? Is there a marketplace or a network of dealers who are specifically interested in purchasing gold? And how is the selling price determined? I know the gold market has fluctuating spot prices, but does that fully control what you’ll be paid? Are there fees or deductions to expect from the buyer, and if so, how do those typically work?

Another thing I’m curious about is the process itself. Is selling as straightforward as walking into a shop or dealer with your gold bars, or is it more involved? Do you need certain paperwork or certificates of authenticity to get the best value? For those who’ve gone through it, how was your experience? Were there any surprises, such as the buyer's inspection process or additional costs like testing?

I’m asking because I’ve heard mixed opinions. Some say the resale market can be a bit tricky due to premiums, buyer fees, and market demand.

investing,Why is the $3000 capital loss deduction so low?,"I get you can apply capital losses against capital gains to minimize your taxable gains.  I get there is a carryover where if you take more losses than gains, you can apply those losses against future gains.  I get that there is a $3000 capital loss deduction where if your losses exceed your gains, you can apply $3000 against your ordinary income.  

I just don't get why that value is so low.  Like, one year I took over 100k in losses (sounds worse than it was) and I suppose if I never were to have gains, I could just apply it against $3000 in annual income for the next 33 years.  $3000 seems like such a small amount, though.  I asked ChatGPT:

&gt;The **$3,000 capital loss deduction limit** has remained unchanged for individuals since it was established under the **Tax Reform Act of 1976**. Since then, the limit has neither increased nor decreased, even though inflation has eroded its value over time. The limit was originally set at $3,000 to allow taxpayers to offset other income with investment losses, but it has not been adjusted for inflation in the decades since its introduction.

Adjusted for inflation, $3000 in today's dollars would be $16,583.83.    That amount makes a lot more sense to me.   Why hasn't this been increased in decades?  ",1726085060.0,278,139,1fejp13

personalfinance,Is it Worth Investing in a 401(k) If I Plan to Leave the U.S. Within 3-7 Years?,"Hey everyone,

I just started my job and am currently thinking about contributing to a 401(k) at my job. I am new to personal finances and am admittedly quite ignorant and uneducated.

A few things about me:

* International Student on F-1 STEM OPT (Means that I have 3 years to work here then can take up grad school to extend to 7 years)
* Fully intend to go home after whatever time
* Make around 120k gross
* Employer contributes \~5% to 401(k) regardless of my contribution

Let me preface this by saying that I understand the value of a 401(k) and if I were staying in the US, I probably would be aiming to max it out for retirement. 

However, since I am will be going back home - it has forced me to think of a few alternatives which I would like to get advice on. I've been researching across the subreddit and google and came up with this, would love to hear thoughts on it / if it is feasible in the first place / any potential concerns or suggestions.

The general idea: **Max out contributions to my 401(k) -&gt; Convert it a Roth IRA when I leave the country -&gt; Access money earlier if needed**

Rationale behind this strategy:

1. Maxing out my 401(k) contribution allows me to decrease taxable income which saves me \~$200 a month
2. Allows me to invest and accrue earnings as well
3. When I leave the country and leave my job, I will convert / rollover to a Roth IRA. I believe I will get taxed at this point (both contributions and earnings) but since I live in Asia, I will likely be making substantially less or will stop working for awhile. **This will minimize the taxes that I will owe (Am most unsure about this step)**
4. At this point, I can choose to keep my money in the Roth IRA until I am 59 or access money earlier if needed. If accessing earlier, I will no longer be taxed and penalized for withdrawing my contributions. I can still be taxed and penalized (additional 10%) on earnings. However, if I wait 5 years and use that for a Qualified Exception like a First-time home purchase, I can avoid both.

I’m trying to weigh the pros and cons. Is this too complicated? Will it not work? Or am I better off putting money in a HYSA / mutual funds instead of putting it through the 401(k) and Roth IRA.

  
I have also been thinking of contacting a fiduciary advisor but have been put off by the high fees (\~$2000 for a 1 time consultation)

I’d appreciate any insights, personal experiences, or resources you might have! Thanks in advance!

My job offers an incredible 401k contribution, matching 85 cents on the dollar. It sounds nice contributing the max of $23,000 a year and getting an additional $19,550 from my employer but it isn’t practical. I am living at home and have little to no expenses so I plan on saving and investing big. The question is just how much should I contribute to the 401k?

personalfinance,A tale of two HSAs… ,"I'm a n00b at the investing side of personal finance.  

I left job 1 in 2022 with \~$4k in a Fidelity HSA. This is an interest bearing account.  It is still open, but now empty.   
Job 2 health plan had no HSA.  I used funds from the Fidelity HSA for medical expenses.  
Job 3 has an HSA through HSA Bank.  Employer contributes $750/yr., I have set up payroll deductions so that the account will hit my deductible amount after a year.  

However, it's been only 4 months, and I’m expecting a medical expense that is well beyond my deductible soon.  I’m looking at making a post-tax contribution to my HSA to make up the difference.

The HSA Bank account has an option to invest - there are management options &amp; ETF options but I have no way of knowing what is available to me without going through the enrollment process.  And there are fees (.1%, .25%, .35% depending on level of mgmt.).  I'll assume the standard non-invest account bears no interest, as this place seems shady enough already. 

Questions:

* Should I ""Enroll in HSA Invest"" with my HSA Bank account?  
* Should I keep the Fidelity account alive (I was aiming to close it out)?  
   * If so, should I use the Fidelity account to funnel money through for the large medical expense, instead of the HSA Bank account?  
   * Would it make sense to make additional contributions here for long term-investment purposes? 
      * Can I roll the HSA bank funds to this account if I leave this job?

personalfinance,Investment math - inflation? ,"Hi, I am newly looking into the math related to basic compound interest taking into account the rate of return (versus the “real rate of return”, RRR, accounting for inflation). 

I am a bit confused. 

My 401k is invested in a target based fund which I understand rebalances depending on my retirement year (approx 2055 - in 30 years as I am 30 years old). How do I find out the rate of return? How do I calculate the expected RRR accounting for inflation? 

Some money is in my 401k but due to future employment changes I will be using other investments for most of my money - S&amp;P 500. I’ve read the rate of return is 10% and adjusted for inflation is around 6%. 

I have $255,000 saved right now. Assuming I will retire in 30 years, if I add no more money will it really grow to 1.5 million (assuming 6% real rate of return)? How do I figure out what that’s worth - or does it already account for inflation given the 6% rather than 10%? I am having issues figuring out if I am basically done saving forever or if I need to keep contributing (I will continue to save of course but trying to see if I have met the goal or still need to save X amount per month). I am just surprised that (per the calculators I am using) my current savings will already be 1.5 mil at age 60 so I’m wondering if I am missing some major part of the calculation.

personalfinance,Trust &amp; beneficiary advice,"Hi - I (F26) and my brothers and sisters 
just received a request from a wealthy grandfather something relating to a trust he sent up for us. Can someone help me interpret?

Some back story: our mother has been disinherited from our wealthy grandfather for some time, and us kids haven’t spoken to him (not more than an email or two) in over 10 years. 

Today we received an email from said grandfather informing us that “we were included as specific beneficiaries under my [his] trust for a specific sum”. He informs us that he is closing his trust (our assumption is so that our mother cannot get it or sue the trust as his death), and that he wants to send us a check in a few a days. 

The email reads “By acceptance or renouncement  of this check, this will extinguish your status as the intended beneficiary.” 

So if I’m reading that correctly, by responding to this email (by either accepting or renouncing), we will be removed as beneficiaries. Does that mean if we do respond, he is unable to remove us as a beneficiary? Does anyone know any legal workaround on why he would be doing this? Instead of just keeping us as his beneficiaries? What happens if we don’t respond? 

Also, it says a “specific sum”. Is there a law on a certain amount? Or could he literally pay us $1 and then legally we are no longer beneficiaries?

I have been going back and forth on this and driving myself a little crazy. Hoping for some third-party input. I have a pretty significant (to me) raise coming up next year. I've been dreaming of a nicer place, but I've also been dreaming of maxing my 457 for the first time. I would like to do both, but am not sure it's feasible. Financial and other details are as follows:

**Current:**

* Age: 35 turning 36 in Los Angeles. 
* Marital: Recently single. Hopefully will have another partner one day but not interested in children at all.
* Salary: jump from 70k to 88k this month
* Net Worth: $200k (this does not include my governmental pension contributions). 
* \*\*$167k invested and $33k cash, which includes a fully funded emergency fund as well as other sinking funds for several things in the future.
* Savings/Retirement Contribution: 11% pre-tax to pension, 25% pre-tax to 457b. $291 post-tax bi-weekly to my Roth IRA fund. Max invested on January 1st every year. 
* Car: 2022 Impreza fully paid
* Current Budget: $2800/month including food, groceries, fun money, bills etc. I am regularly under budget for the month and track this diligently. 
* \*\*I save roughly $2000 a month thanks to the odd overtime shift.  $1417 of this goes to general savings and sinking funds and $583 to fund next years IRA as mentioned above.

**Next year:**

* Salary: $101k. I will receive two raises next year. April 2025 $98k and July $101k. Hoping to move in July.
* Anticipated Budget: \~$3450/month. My anticipated budget will stay the same except for an increase in rent and utilities.
* Paycheck: \~ $2100 bi-weekly, not including overtime which has been frequent as of late but is not guaranteed. 
* Math: My budget estimate leaves me $750 remaining with $600 earmarked for my IRA. **Total left after everything $150 if I do not work any overtime.** 

And lastly, Notes: 

\*\*I do not contribute to Social Security

\*\*Overtime is non-pensionable and on average has netted me an extra $500 a month on average in the last 1.5 years. I don't want to count on it though

\*\*My financial goal is early retirement at 55, so investing heavily is a key component of that but I sure would like a nicer place.

 \*\*This would be a non-starter for me if I was still in the process of building my emergency fund or my sinking funds, but with them fully-funded, I feel like I need a lot less cash?

Started at a community college right when I graduated highschool (actually took some courses in highschool) but it took me a long time to figure out my education and career goals and get into a university (actually the university of my choice).

Now, I've been at my university almost 5 years now, and have had trouble because of mostly undiagnosed mental health disorders.

Luckily I've been diagnosed and found the help I need.

But... becsuse I took about a 2 year break for my mental health and a few other factors, I'm still basically a freshman for my major.

I finally feel ready to start back at my university, but, because of some misunderstandings and mistakes with my education I owe A LOT to my university. And, while I'm in good academic standing, because I owe so much, I can't register until I pay a minimum amount back. Which, right now, is about 7000.

Now, I'm a very broke person. So is my family. And so I don't seem to have anyone I can get help from. My income (Doordashing currently) is low and my credit score isn't good. And I don't have anyone that could cosign on a loan at the moment I think.

And I've done the math and if I pay off what I owe with as much as I can monthly, currently, it looks like it will take me another 2 years to pay off what I need to start back.

And if I have to wait that long, okay. But if there is a way for me to pay back and start back sooner, I wanna take it.

School and education are my passions, my goals. And honestly, if I could take out a private loan to pay it off and hop back in soon, I'll likely do it. Despite the long term cost.

Is there any option you can think of, or tips (DO NOT SUGGEST I END MY EDUCATION)?

How can I get back into my education quicker?

personalfinance,I think I messed up 401k cash out/conversion… is it too late to fix?,"I recently left my job and decided I wanted to convert my 401k (about 33k) to a Roth IRA. I filled out the rollover paperwork and they mailed me a check deposit into the Roth IRA. I mistakenly thought they would automatically deduct 20% or so for taxes, but I was wrong and now realizing I have to pay the taxes with other funds. 

I tried googling and it seems like if I use some of the check towards taxes, I’d end up with an early withdrawal penalty (I’m 27). My question is, is it possible to change the account that I’m depositing the check into? Like, could I open a traditional IRA and put the check in there to avoid taxes now? Or is it too late since the account number of the Roth IRA is on the check.

personalfinance,Should I pay off a mortgage debt immediately if I have double that in cash?,"My father has recently passed away with some retirement money, while my family has a mortgage debt that is roughly half the size of that retirement fund. The current interest rate of that mortgage is around 3.5% APR, pay every two weeks and going to be paid in full in around 5-6 years. My father philosophy was invest that money into a index fund instead of paying it in full immediately since the average annual return of the index fund is higher than the mortgage APR. But now since he has passed away, while the rest of us have less financial knowledge than he did, we are wondering if we should continue his plan or just use it to pay off the entire mortgage immediately.

I personally invest my own money in VT but do not consider myself experienced in investment.

edit: spelling

edit: I forgot to mention, currently the mortgage payment is a bit difficult to pay off only based on our income, so we can't just quite put the entire amount in an index fund and has to use some of it to pay the mortgage payment",1727915430.0,11,70,1fuvc8h

personalfinance,Upside down on truck but want to get rid of it,"So I have a truck that I owe 38k on but it’s valued at 23k trade in. Long story short, I get a vehicle allowance so when I got it I didn’t really care to put anything down because the payment was covered by this vehicle allowance. Basically, it’s been a total piece of crap and has been one of those trucks that just can never not have something wrong with it. On top of that I’ve had 2 insurance claims that brought the value down and my insurance up (attempted theft and an accident). I just want it gone. My company used to require a truck (since it’s called a truck allowance) but they no longer care what you drive. I want to get something good on gas (currently spending 115/week on diesel) and that will be reliable. My insurance also went way up after the claims. 

I get my annual bonus in February which would bring me down to a reasonable amount where I could get pretty close to pay-off if I were to put my whole bonus on my note. But I also don’t want to wait that long when some of the issues I’ve had with the truck have been catastrophic (I.e. cp4 pump 12000 dollar fix). 

I guess my question is what would you recommend in this situation? I’m looking at a used Mazda 6 that’s 19k so even the negative equity would have my payments lower than what they are now, my insurance would go down and my weekly gas spending would be less than half what it is now. Can I even finance that much negative equity?

personalfinance,Comparing two health plans. Did I miss something ?!,"Hi All. This might be my first post here. Please let me know if this is not the appropriate sub.

I'm trying to find out whether I did good on my health plan choice this year. I know the year is not over but I'll just assume Jan-Sep is enough representative. 

I'd be real happy if some people here are bored and want to go over my calculations or spot some glaring error.

So medical expenses = $1,735 (Credit Card) + $1,567 (FSA). Obviously I put less money in FSA than my real medical expenses. So it maxed out and the rest went to the CC i.e. Out of pocket

Number of visits = 15

Tax bracket = 22%

So **Health plan 1** : $50 copay per visit. Total Paycheck deductions = $3,600. So total expenses = $3,600 + $50\*15 = approx. $4,350

Now assuming the copays are paid with the FSA card, both copays and paycheck deductions are pretax. So I'll take out 22% Tax savings , so the real expense = $4,350 \* (1-0.22) = $3,393

**Health plan 2** : High deductible plan. Deductible wasn't met. Payroll deductions = $650. I'll only apply tax deductions to the payroll deductions and the amount charged on the FSA.

So total real expense = $1,735 + 78% \* ($1,567 + $650) = approx. $3,465

Remember 78% is 100% minus the 22% tax savings because of the 22% tax bracket.

So based on this:

- Health plan 1 is slightly superior (and less hassle - just a simple copay)

- Had I put more money on my FSA, Health plan 2 would've been a clear winner (but a bit more hassle).

I understand there are complications with coinsurance and the slight differences of what is covered under each plan, but I choose to ignore them at the moment because this is a rough analysis.

Does this sound reasonable ?! Did I go wrong ?!

personalfinance,Need help thinking through home refinancing decision,"Hi all! Refinancing a home for the first time, and I wanted to hear some thoughts on if I am completely thinking about this the wrong way.

1) My mortgage agent proposed a 'no money at close' financing arrangement where essentially I'm getting a lender credit by selling points (rather than buying down the rate, selling rate)

2) My current rate is HORRIBLE - 7.5%. Even after making the 'no cost' (nothing in this life is no cost) refinance, my rate would go to 6.75% with 30Y Fixed or 6.25% with a 7/1 ARM.

3) So in doing so, I would essentially be trading in my current mortgage (which I only started \~6 months ago) for 'no money' (out of pocket) to have a lower rate (saving me \~$500/month).

4) I have also checked and there is no penalty or lock in period with the refi - it can always be re-refinanced

Am I crazy for thinking this is a no-doubter decision? With rates being a bit shaky right now (supposed to go down with the Fed, but Treasury rates are sticky/going up), I sort of feel like locking in value 'free' right now makes sense, since when rates continue to go down I can consider another more aggressive rate refinance OR if for some reason rates go back up, I won't feel dumb for not having saved the money for free when I could.

All of her possessions and finances are in a trust (not much in there we aren't rich) and the beneficiaries are my mom,  my uncle, and me (being added soon).

My uncle does not want anything as he is financially well off. My mother is a fool with money and there is no hope for her being able to be approved or afford the monthly payment of the mortgage.  My credit is currently bad so I couldn't get approved,  but I could afford the payment (working on my credit).

So we were thinking of insurance options just in case.  Life insurance is not really an option.  Very high premiums with a very small payout (25k max) for my grandma.

In May I graduated from physical therapy school with my doctorate. During that time, I both lived above my means, and truly had an extensive series of issues with the cars that I owned throughout school (not at the same time) that had to be thrown onto a credit card. Either way, I know I'm fully responsible and now trying to make a plan to get out of the situation I'm in.

I have a Discover It card that has just under $22k on it, minimum payment is about $500/mo.

My parents also floated me 10k during school to help pay for an $18k car after I was in an accident, and that car recently blew a head gasket so I sold it for $8k to CarMax. So I'm 10k underwater to my parents with nothing to show for it, but thankfully they're not charging me interest. I am also currently driving my girlfriend's grandma's '05 Corolla (that I sadly can't purchase from her family) until I figure something out for myself.

I recently began a job as a PT making $77500 a year, coming out to \~$4500 a month net. No 401k contribution yet, don't have health insurance yet either which is an immediate priority.

My fixed monthly expenses (still bit of an estimate as my gf and I moved to this place a month ago):

Rent/Utilities: 1400

Car Insurance: 400 w/USAA (2 accidents + 2 speeding tickets in the past 3 years, it was a rough time. I've learned a lot now, but I'm paying this on a 2012 370Z I don't even own anymore until I get a different car)

Gas: 100

Discover Minimum: 500

Loan to parents: 100-200 I guess

I will now also be adding an actual monthly car payment ($300/mo?), will need to acquire health insurance since I just turned 26 (also like $300/mo?), and will have student loan payments starting in December which I can hopefully get on an IDR plan if any of that clears up before the year ends. So that adds maybe \~$1k to every month starting very soon.

That totals at $3600/4500 fixed monthly cost, with only paying the minimum on the Discover. 

I've started a budget, trying my best to minimize extraneous expenses. I also haven't used the Discover card in about a month. I feel like I can start to make a strategy but the interest on the CC is obviously what's doing me in the most. So for the questions/advice:

* Do I try to balance transfer some to a new card? I doubt I could do that to the entire balance, and I obviously wouldn't be able to pay $22k even with an 18 month 0% period. Is it still worth it to try to transfer some of the money? 
* Do I convert the balance of the discover card to a personal loan? But would that then remove it from my credit history, or is it possible to negotiate down the rate itself with Discover and keep the line open or something
* Should I just put my head down, contribute an extra 4-500 to the card and work with 4-500 a month for food/spending for a few years?
* Do I go find a PRN PT job to work some weekend days and try to speed the entire process up a bit?
* All of the above?
* Prolly can't answer this one but how do I not let money stress bleed into every waking moment :)

Hi! So to begin with I’m 23, I have a decent job and I am finally in a place where I’m working consistently. 

While working on getting disability filed with my work, I was out 2 weeks. I used what was basically a payday loan with my bank. I’m supposed to make about $800 (before insurance and tax) every 2 weeks. I end up with around $500 in my paycheck before the payday loan. After the loan, I end out with around $350. 

I pay $150 in rent one paycheck and $150 in various bills the next paycheck. ($3 for Hulu, $10 for internet, $100 in car insurance, $4 for internet on switch, and $14 for Spotify) which leaves me with like $200. And there are 3 people living in my house, only me and my partner are able to contribute (taking care of my mom who’s disabled does help with rent, which keeps it so low.

Me and him spend about $100 a piece on food every 2 weeks. 

I feel like I’m left with pennys, I can’t save and when something happens, we have no money put up. And my partners bills go to the same thing as me pretty much, his own bills and then rent/lights.

We are going through some pretty horrible things right now, within the home and just in general. And these big expenses are coming left and right. I also have over $2000 in debt from various financial issues like health, losing my job during covid and taking out a credit card, and other stuff in the past. 

I’m really not sure how to get ahead, I don’t want to cut out the few expenses in my life that are worth keeping (literally just Spotify, Hulu, and switch internet.) and even if I did it would only be like $20 a month. I also feel like I have a decent grip on my spending habits and such. I really don’t know what I can do to get ahead. I know the obvious answers like “get a better job.” But it took me 2 years to get this work at home job that pays this decently that communicates well with my ADAAA.

personalfinance,Math behind how much to contribute to 529 plan,"I opened a 529 plan for my unborn child and have started receiving and making contributions. I was hoping to receive some help confirming or correcting my math.

Assumptions: 

- Child will enter college in the fall of 2042 and graduate at the end of the 2045-2046 school year.
- Tuition and fees for the school he/she will attend is currently $20,000 for the 2024-2045 school year.
- Food, Housing, Books, Supplies, and Other Expenses is $18,000 for the 2024-2025 school year.
- The expected yearly increase for tuition and fees is 4.8% and the expected yearly increase for food, housing, etc. is 3%.

2042-2043 School Year - Total = $77,152.38

2043-2044 School Year - Total = $80,304.10

2044-2045 School Year - Total = $83,590.56

2045-2046 School Year - Total = $87,017.64

4-Year Degree - Total = 328,064.77

The 529 plan has $2,400 right now. If I want to fully fund the child's college education at a 7% yearly return on the investments, I would need to contribute ~$755 per month starting this month until the child enters college in August 2042.

personalfinance,Clarification for HSA (HDHP) funds?,"Hey everyone,

Mods, apologies if I am using the wrong flair (I wasn’t sure if this question falls under investing or retirement, or other…)

This is my first year ever having access to an HSA (HDHP).

My employer is fronting the full deductible limit  amount of our company’s HSA right at the beginning. My question then is: would it make sense for me to invest my contributions?

This is based off of the advice I’ve read/heard from financial channels and boards about taking advantage of the power of compounding earnings on HSA contributions. 

I’ve elected to have a limited FSA for any additional unexpected medical costs (beyond routine checkups) on top of having the employer fronted limit provided, just in case.

So I figure that it would be, for retirement purposes, good then for me to invest my contributions and pay out of pocket for anything the my limited FSA doesn’t cover. I ideally would not want to touch the employer fronted deductible limit unless absolutely necessary, but I like having the peace of mind of keeping this amount non-invested in case I do need to use my HSA.

If I’m misunderstanding something or am wrong about how this works, please let me know. I’m still working on learning the intricacies of HSAs. Super excited to finally have one!",1727903142.0,1,8,1fur2gu

personalfinance,Stuck with expensive auto loan - need advice,"Incredibly long story short, I'm recovering from a financially (among others) abusive situation and have most things in order besides this cursed auto loan. 

It's about $20,000 (approx. my current yearly salary as an AmeriCorps VISTA) and in my &amp; my mother's name, as co-borrowers. The monthly payment is $465, which will NOT fit into my current budget, but if needed I could try to get a part-time job in addition to my full-time job. My credit score is good (~720) but that's about the same as it was two years ago when I acquired the loan. The current term is 72 months. My next payment is due on October 21st. I don't think I'm in deficit but I think it would ultimately depend on who I sold to (KBB valued at  $19,163-22,078, exact loan amount is currently $19,944)

What do I do?

Ideally, I'd like to sell the car and get a beater until I can actually afford something like this. However, I'm unsure if I could sell it without the co-borrowers signature.
I could refinance it to a longer loan term for smaller monthly payments (again, until I can afford something more), but I'm again unsure if that's something I can do without the signature. 

I can try to get her signature, but it's unlikely I'll be able to (at least, not under terms I'm willing to agree to). 

I could try to get a second job and make the payments indefinitely, but that's not an option i'm particularly pleased with because 1) it's a link - though distant - to a horrible situation and it's the last shred of control they have over me. 2) the loan is in a different state than I'm living now, and I'm planning to move across the country in the next two years, and the loan introduces all sorts of complications with registration, state taxes, and tag renewal.

Keeping the car would be a huge plus, because it's a good car that will likely last me years, but it's a huge financial stressor and I'm questionable if my wallet can handle it right now. 

I could voluntarily repossess the car, but that hits my credit, and my credit is ultimately of utmost importance - it's my only chance at ever owning a home. Plus, she's in deficit. 

I live in a rural area, which thankfully gives me cheaper rent, but it also means I need a car to live and work. I could go without one very temporarily, by the kindess of my friends and employer, but need one long-term. 

It's a super sticky situation all around and I don't know what my next/best move is. If anyone has any advice or helpful info/resources please let me know 🙏",1727899355.0,1,5,1fupku9

personalfinance,Is it worth it for me to switch to a new car?,"Hi folks! I(23f) am currently struggling with my finance. I drive a 2013 Honda CRV with a mileage of about 200,000 miles. The estimated trade-in value by Edmunds is $5500. My concern is that the car's mpg is 19.6. My job requires me to drive more than 60 miles per day. So the cost is definitely a burden. I am thinking about maybe switching to a more fuel-efficient car.

I saw on Edmunds that there are very cheap used Toyota Prius that has an excellent mpg of around 45. For example, there's a 2007 Prius with a mileage of 16,3000 miles at the price of $5500. Most of the choices on the market are older than my car but has lower mileage.

The CRV is my first car. I don't have  a lot of experience with cars. My main concern is that if I switch to an older car and at some point have to repair it, I won't be able to afford it. I also don't want to get into debt to buy a car that is significantly more expensive than my CRV(slightly more expensive is OK, within $3000)

If I do decide to change my car, should I prioritize mileage or age? Is it better to have an old car with lower mileage or a high mileage newer car?

Also I'm in California. The sales tax is also one factor to be considered.

Left my job recently and realized I have to do something with my 401(k) account through Merrill - I wasn’t at the job long so it has $260 in it. I haven’t received it yet, but according to Merrill I should be receiving a letter within 60 days with the option of cashing out or rolling over to another account. I am moving cross country at the end of the month so do not have a new job yet and can’t roll the balance over into my next employer’s account. 

I called Merrill to discuss basic info/options and was quickly transferred to three different agents (who didn’t get much info from me), the third of which was an eager financial advisor who lost interest/pretty much laughed me off the phone when I told him the balance, lectured me about monthly expenses and was generally unhelpful and rude lol. 

The one piece of info I did get was that the only account I would be eligible for through Merrill would be a self-directed IRA - which is definitely an option I’m keeping in mind, but wanted to see if anyone here has any advice/preferred IRAs/knows of other options? I don’t want to withdraw and wish I could just leave it there, but I can’t :/

investing,Inheritance - asset price and asset income discrepancy in europe,"Me and my wife both inherited a good junk of farmland, which in my area has a value of around 20mm. problem is, our families have owned that land for some couple hundreds of years (we are based in europe not US) and so the emotional constraints are fairly large. Also, the combined rental income for the farmland is only approx. 50k p.a.. That would be an astonishing 0.25% return on capital before tax. And i am not joking to you - our market is completely out of balance.

  
We also have the same problem with houses. We both will inherit 2-3 houses each and every single one has to be renovated which would ultimately eat all profits for 20-30 years. Pay for renovation would be around 3k/sqm and would yield around 10€/sqm/month when rented out. I mean come on.

  
I know this is a very privileged problem (we both had the pure luck of beeing born into very old families - though no aristocracies), but it still bothers me. take 25 million on any conservative investment with like 5% return and you have 1.25 mill per year for generations to come.

investing,"Is the concept of ""Equity Risk Premium"" shrinking over time?","When I first learnt about investing and studied it from free online materials, I found it very strange that Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is a thing because in my mind, if the market is pricing a stock fairly, it should account for the risk in future cashflows/dividends (earnings) by lowering expectation in earnings instead of ""demanding more returns"" by having ERP. Academic concepts like ""stock beta"" make zero sense no matter how I try to rationalise it.

A few years ago, I also came across Equity Premium Puzzle (EPP) which shows equities have outperformed debt significantly (by 5% to 8%) even when considering survivorship bias. There are studies with over 100 years of data. Since survivorship bias cannot explain EPP, I concluded that perhaps humans are just not very good at pricing equities fairly relative to debt and overcompensate for the risk of equities.

Right now, it seems like every stock is expensive and I'm wondering if this is going to be the new normal. As technology gets better thus access to public information (e.g. company info, economic news, world events, etc) gets easier, and more younger people learning about investing online (since schools around the world don't teach personal finance ever), are equity prices just going to be priced higher (i.e. lower ERP) because now the equity market gets more competitive?

ERP and EPP have always been a very interesting topic to me, but it's hard to find any deep discussion on this.",1725954996.0,15,26,1fdcj3a

Recently, someone suggested I should look into real estate investing, but since I live in California, we all know how tricky the real estate market is here. 🏠💸

So, I’m torn... Should I keep pumping that extra $8k into the stock market? Maybe stash it in a high-yield savings account and wait for the right time to buy an investment property? Or is there another approach I haven’t thought about yet?

If you were in my position, what would you do? I’d love to hear your strategies and advice. 🙏

Thanks in advance!

investing,Do I really need a wealth manager?,"I've been managing around $500k in an old IRA and a brokerage account with E-Trade, not to mention my company 401k.

investing,Cotton option futures - 1 to 2 year hold?,"I've been looking at the cotton Market recently and wanted to get peoples thoughts to see what I'm missing (assuming a lot). 

Cotton prices are around $67 the lowest I can see they have gone over the last 20 years is about $40. 

The combination of China, India and Brazil make up about 60% or more of total production (US is also a producer around 10%).

All countries are expected to have a lower than usual production this year with American being at a 14 year low. 

If you look at price spikes you can see there have been spikes in 2011 and 2018 (there have been spikes in other years as well like covid). My understanding of these spikes was driven by a la nina event (increased rain fall in certain counties). Which is expected this year.

Whilst Cotton prices typically favour higher rainfall they do not like flooding (which is occurring in at least one of the main area in India and I'm assuming some (not verified) in China). 

You may say well that makes no difference to the price given it is outside the growing (April - June ) and harvesting (August to September) months but it did in 2011 and 2018. 

What am I missing? Could the lowish price of cotton be a good buy or should I wait for more data and if so what data?

investing,Should I continue the course and invest slowly in stock market or take money out to purchase a investment property,"For background: I am 34m, make about ~$350k/year.

I own my primary residence which is worth ~$800k and has a mortgage left of ~$530k.  I pay monthly $5k for mortgage + taxes + insurance and an additional $3.5k goes to investment in the stock market (current portfolio worth ~$250k) 

My mom is selling her house and I was considering buying it off her.  The caveat is that I would have to sell my current stocks for the down payment. The total for the house is approximately $1.1 million.

The house itself is a house I grew up in. It’s about 20 years old and it’s in a very attractive spot in terms of renting and finding tenants. It’s also a duplex legally, so it can be rented to multiple tenants. 

To be able to afford this house, I would have to sell my stocks and put a down payment of approximately $200k and take out a loan for the rest. The way finance would work is the rent should be able to cover the entirety of the mortgage + taxes + insurance.  Essentially, I would not have to pay anything additional out of pocket (except for unexpected expenses). 

The reason this is attractive for me is because of the location. My mom originally built the house in 2003 for ~$450k and today it’s selling for $1.1 million. In addition, the location has further developed since where there’s a major shopping complex as well as an arena being built close to the house, making it even more attractive and I can certainly see the investment doubling if not more in the next 20 years.  I still continue to plan to invest in the stock market, but the volatility has really made me more skeptic about investing in general in the market. Most of my money is actually in ETFs, but I still find it too unpredictable for my liking (have been investing for 8 years now and more seriously for the last 6 years).

The monthly payment including mortgage + taxes + insurance will be around $7.5k for the house and expected rent is about the same so should fully be covered.  Once the house is paid off, the monthly rental income could be even $10k by then.

I would take a small hit with taxes with selling the portfolio since some of them are short-term investments but I think in the long-run, the house could be highly valuable.

investing,Share distribution in equal weighted index ETFs,"I'm looking into placing some money in an equal weighted S&amp;P500 ETF  - RSP.

I already own DIA (DJIA).

What I noticed is that in DIA there are an equal number of shares for each stock.  And that matches my understanding of how the  DJIA was designed - for better or worse.

Then I looked into RSP.  The prospectus says the following:

""The Underlying Index is an equal-weighted version of the Parent Index (S&amp;P 500®Index). “Equal weighting” means that, unlike the Parent Index  which employs a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted methodology, the Underlying Index assigns each component security the same weight at each quarterly rebalance.""

I looked at the holdings in the ETF, an it appears to me that they try and have an equal ""% of Net Assets"" for each stock, with a quartely rebalancing.   Currently the percentages for the respective stocks varies from 0.26% (for K, 2.0M shares, $160.4M market value) down to 0.15% (for DPG, 221.1k shares, $89.2M market value). 

I hear ""equal weighting"" mentioned quite often and assumed it was **always** like the case in DIA.  An equal number of shares are  purchased for each stock in the index.

But in the case of RSP, the definition appears different.  It will increase the number of shares for a falling stock price and decrease the number of shares for a rising stock price in the quarterly rebalancing.  This would be done so as to keep the ""% of Net Assets"" equal for each stock in the index.   So in a rough sense, it does sort of factor in market capitalization as reflected in the increase or decrease in stock prices. **Is my understanding correct?**

does that mean they already put in account to hold 16.4 years? to be finally $20 for $20?

EDIT: u/SirGlass suggested in the comments below the terminology is ‘turnover ratio.’ I like it and think it can work. Thanks.

What I am talking about is the frequency, or period, that you invest an amount, reclaim it and move it into a different investment.

An example would be if someone had a fixed amount they want to do dividend capture with.

e.g. You have $100.  You can buy $100 of stock the day before the ex date, and then sell it whenever the price recovers after ex date.  Once  recovered you could use that same $100 to capture another dividend. Repeat.  The $100 keeps ”revolving” or “cycling” or “rotating” or “churning“ or “rolls.” What is the terminology?

What would be the terminology used to describe that rate or period of recovering and reinvesting the same dollars repeatedly? What is the terminology use to describe the frequency investment dollars go from being held to liquid to held again?

My dad (83) has been in a slow decline physically and mentally since around 2017. In July he ended up in the hospital and has been back and forth between there and a rehab facility since then. Mom got his passwords so I could have a look at his investment accounts. He was always interested and active in the stock market as long as I can remember. What I saw in one of his IRA's was troubling. It showed a drop of over 50% in the last 3+ years.  So I exported all transactions going back to the start of 2020 and tied out the buys and sells.

The good news was that part of the drop was from mandatory IRA distributions. And his stock trades at least had a positive return, though if he'd just bought VOO he would probably have done 5x better. At least he was disciplined with his stop losses.

The bad news was that he lost over $200k gambling with options. He'd been buying calls and puts wallstreetbets style.

He has 40 open stock positions and another dozen active call options that mostly expire in September or October. I had been hesitant to take any action since it's not my account. But I looked at it today and compared it to a week ago and wish I had closed out the options at the start of the week. Rough week for call options. I think on Monday I may close out the options that still have some value. I'll leave the stocks as is, but maybe I should put stop loss orders on the ones that don't have stops? He was pretty consistent about setting stops 20% below the current price and adjusting them.

Anyone here had to deal with this? Any advice? Mom is fine with me doing whatever. Don't think Dad will ever recover enough mentally to get back to trading, but it is a possibility. We changed his passwords and that might be enough to keep him out. ",1725742969.0,45,34,1fbh52t

investing,Canadian that recently(ish) found out I'm American - are my investments fucked?,"Hey there, so I was born and raised in Canada but during the pandemic I found out I was American. Long story short, my grandfather was born in New York, my father was born in Canada, but because he spent X amount of time in the US before I was born he passed on citizenship to me.

Up until now I've had my money in a TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account) which is after-tax money that isn't taxed at all by the Canadian Government. Apparently the IRS sees it as a foreign trust and does not recognize the tax-free status.

If I transfer it to my RRSP (our version of a 401K) I'll have to pay tax on it when I take it out, even though it was completely funded with after-tax money. So, double tax.

If I sell anything, I pay capital gains tax.

So, am I fucked 6 ways from Sunday here?

Is there any American equivalent to the TFSA where I get contribution room of 5000-6000 per year (that accumulates every year eg when you're 30 you now have 72,000 contribution room if you've never deposited money before)?

  
Edit: I should make this more clear- when I found out I was American I took all the steps to get a passport and a SSN and moved down to the US a year and a half ago",1725687252.0,74,72,1fazud9

investing,micro portfolio to start with - 500-1000$ USD ,"so, I've got a few questions (Canadian citizen here)

a) is it feasable - I mean, starting off with 500$ worth of stocks, selling 1/10th of options (maybe) or just stacking up until 100 - are there apps/brokers that allow you do start super small?

b) buying low price stocks with great potential until you reach 100 to start selling contract(s) .. contracts xD .. one put at the time.

c) what would be your best platform to register with, keeping in mind I'm Canadian and do not have access to all the fancy USA apps?

goals are :

make steady tiny cash while feeding the account daily for about 1000$ USD a month ; build a position with stocks I have faith in (2-3 of them) .. at 2-6$ price range.

eventually, start buying puts / selling covered calls with short DTE, say 30-60 days, and some leaps if the settings feel good ; for more % profits, increasing stocks, more movement possibility, etc., rince and repeat

investing,What's the shortest investment horizon where you have a 90% chance of stocks beating risk free returns? ,"I'm learning about statistics recently, and have been playing with 95% confidence intervals for some coursework in R. Does anyone know of any analysis of stock market return 95% or 90% confidence intervals over different timelines? It seems to me to be such an obvious statistical tool someone must have done some analyses with the stock market that are public available show risk in this way? 

I would ideally like to know the shortest investment timeline where, based on historical data, the stock market has a 90 or 95% chance of beating the risk free rate of return, but I don't yet have the statistical skills to calculate this myself. If I can't find data like this, I might go at it myself once I'm a little further ahead in my data science coursework. 

My issue is when it comes to the question of ""how long should my investment horizon be for stocks to make more sense than HYSAs, CDs, or Money Market Funds"", which seems like a pretty big question to have a good answer too, all anyone has is conjecture and anecdote, with very little quantitative discussion of the risks.

6. I have three savings accounts: gold savings for my oldest's education (around 40 grams), gold savings for my youngest (around 5 grams), and an investment in stocks worth around $3k. I’ve committed to saving 1 gram of gold for each month of my daughters' ages, and I don’t want to use that money for anything other than their education. All our ""free money"" this month was spent on moving out of our apartment to a bigger space to accomodate our 4-month-old.
7. Rent is around $1.5k for 6 months, and it's already paid for the next 6 months. Lately, our income has just been enough to cover our needs with very little extra, nowhere near enough for our daughters' monthly savings or stock purchases.
8. My stocks are pretty low-risk and have been gaining value, so I’m not too worried about them losing value in the short term. However, they also won’t gain significant value quickly.


My wife and I realize that we can’t rent forever, but we also don’t have enough funds for the renovation. We have a target of moving into our home in 6 months, but we're still figuring out how to make that happen.


Option 1: Sell all of our reserves for the renovation. 45 grams of gold and $3k in stocks could net us around $7k, and we could take out a loan of $3k - $8k. Personally, I don’t want to take a loan, and I’m uncomfortable liquidating all of our reserves for this, especially my daughters’ savings. The oldest is about to enter elementary school next year, and I don’t feel comfortable having no savings for her. Plus, a loan would require monthly payments, and I doubt we can afford that right now.


Option 2: Take a loan of $10k - $15k. For the reasons mentioned above, I don't want to take out a loan, but if it’s the only option, we could go that route while minimizing our expenses as much as possible and liquidating reserves as needed.


Option 3: A combination of Option 1 with different proportions. This seems like a reasonable alternative. While I’d have to dip into my daughters’ savings, the amount could be reduced, and the loan payments could be smaller compared to Option 2. The problem is, I’m not sure how much I should set aside for savings, an emergency fund (if any), or how much of a loan I can safely take.


What to do? What option do I miss?


Edit: It's around 11.30PM here and I need to go to sleep. Honestly, this is just my way to vent. I’m a pretty frugal person.

personalfinance,Who to talk to about long term care needs,"There’s a decent chance I inherited a genetic disease from my parent and could need long term care in the future.

My vehicle before hand had started to show its age and was on its way out so i sold it for 5500 dollars and used that as a down payment towards a 31-2k vehicle, which after dealer fees is around 34k.

 As i previously stated i had no prior credit history so i had no score to get approved by any banks or institutions besides one that gave me the 27.99% APR over a 72 month period. I agreed to the terms even though rough math that’d mean at the end, if i stuck to payment of the loan without any early payments or anything of the sort, id end up paying 70k~ which would be 981.39/mo. As i stated earlier i have no bills so i can afford this payment as of right now but i of course dont want to dump 70k into a 32k vehicle so I plan on *trying* to refinance by the 10 month mark in hopes by that point ill have enough of a credit score/history to get any kind of better rate than what i have at the moment. 

Given that I was wondering and hoping if any of you all have any advice? and as well I was wondering if I were to apply for a personal loan from my bank for the value of the vehicle which let’s say is 32k for simplicity(depending on the month of payment this number could be adjusted based on how much of the principle is paid by the time i try to do this) and i use that loan to pay the 32k value of the vehicle in the loan(again would be adjusted depending on month of payment and amount of principle paid) would i still need to pay the rest of the 70k which would’ve been interest if i had stuck with the payment plan or would that be the end of the original loan and the start of the new one?(if this would work then id plan on doing this by the 12th month of payment or so for the best rate on said loan) Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!


note: I know the option to sell the vehicle will be given but id rather not part with it because while yes it is my only form of transport now, i also love everything about it and i plan to keep it around and maintain it for many many years to come so id like to not give it up, again any and all advice is so deeply appreciated!",1727885507.0,1,23,1fuk00h

personalfinance,Am I missing anything by considering to refinance my auto loan?,"Just looking for some opinions as I’m trying to reduce my DTI.

Currently have a used auto loan that I took out in 2023 with 6.84% at 72 months. My payment is $510 a month and in the 16 payments I have paid I have paid a total of $1318 in interest. I also pay $50 extra every month.

My credit union (who this loan isn’t with) dropped interest rates and I can get a rate of 5.24% at 60 months bringing my monthly minimum to $450. However I’d be able to pay an additional $100 over principal. So even though I’d be eating the additional 4 months I have already paid for by taking a 60 month loan out I would be saving roughly $1300 on interest over the life of the loan by paying $550 a month at no extra cost. Also I would have the loan paid off in 54 months recovering that 4 month hit.

personalfinance,"Buy a House Now, or Ride it Out?","My wife and I and our 2yo son are considering making the jump from our current house (3br, 2ba, 1500sf) to a ""forever home"" further out into the suburbs.  For context, most of the houses we are looking at are in the 4br, 3ba, 2500sf range which cost about $550k in our area.  We currently pay $1650/mo at 3% on our existing mortgage and have about $225k in equity in our house based on recent sales in the area.  We currently live close to the city in a pretty desirable area, but all of the houses are pretty small and we are already feeling claustrophobic.  We want to have another child in the next year or so, then we will be done having kids.  Unfortunately I don't think having another kid is possible unless we move.   I'm not sure where another kid would even go in our house.  I also work from home, so one of our bedrooms is a home office.  Long story short, our current situation is cozy but not really geared toward our long-term goals.

  
The finance part of this:  We currently have a household income of roughly $14k/month gross, are contributing $1,200/month to retirement pre-tax, and have about $9,700/month net income.  We currently are paying about $1,500/month for daycare, but other than our mortgage we have no debt.  If we have another child, our daycare costs will be roughly $3k/month for a few years, then back down to $1,500, then eventually they will be in school in 5-6 years and those expenses will come off the books. 

It looks like existing rates would put our mortgage payment at roughly $2,800 - $3k for most of the houses we have seen, so between the mortgage and daycare costs, that is more than half of our net income if we have another kid, but we'd only have to put up with that for 5 years.

  
So the question: Do we stay put, or do we buy now?  Mortgage rates may come down, but in our area the demand for housing is high, so I feel pretty confident that house prices will continue to offset that.  Is it dumb to live at the edge of our means for 5-6 years? ",1727882493.0,4,45,1fuirtx

personalfinance,(total noob) What do I need to know / How do I invest with Vanguard?,"So I have money laying around, and rather than have it gather dust I opened a Vanguard account to plan for retirement (I'm 30 now).

------------------Why no roth..

&gt;Late last year I opened a Roth IRA and maxed out contribution for that year and this year.

&gt;Then tax season(USA) rolled around.  
It seems that the amount I'm allowed to contribute is related to the amount I earned via income or something? idk.   
I played around with it(FreeTaxUSA website) a little, and it looked like since I barely worked last year, if I contributed more than a certain amount to my IRA, I'd get a penalty....   
So I withdrew/undid some of my 2023 contributions, and left the 2024 contributions for now.

I have a good amount saved up that I planned to spend by maxing out my Roth IRA yearly, but I guess that's out?

So I'm asking now, how do I Vanguard?   
What do need to know about the ""market funds"" or the ""EFTs""...   
How do I know what to get and how much?

personalfinance,Advice on mortgage overpayment Vs savings,"Hi, I was just after some advice really. 

We currently overpay on our mortgage (500 p/m), which is at a great deal of 0.94% through to 2026. This mortgage allows overpayments of around 20k per annum, and with our standing monthly overpayment we get to around 6k. 

We currently put all our savings into ISAs and whatnot, and my inclination would be to carry on as we are, however the annual overpayment deadline is due this month. Is it worth me chucking 10k from savings at that to reduce it down? (Current mortgage is 95k)

Essentially, does the financial maths of 10k less on interest on the mortgage for the next year come out better than something like 3-4% on a savings account?

I hope I haven't made this more complicated than necessary 🤣",1727880169.0,1,4,1fuhun3

That has not changed in 10 years, because in real life it hasn't changed. When Federal Tax regulation changed a few years back, they stopped withholding any federal taxes from my weekly paycheck, which they deemed to be too low to do so. But, then at the end of the year, When my spouse and I file our taxes, I end up owing about 5k. The cuts the return in half of the over payment reimbursement from my spouses income. 

If it helps you, on June my weekly gross pay went from $330/week to $495/week. The Net was changed from $238/week to $439/week. I need every penny I can get to be able to pay our bills. I am solely responsible for them, as we completely separated out finances in June as well. My spouse pays their half of the bills by giving me the money, so we can save the headache and hiccups of changing how payments are made. 

I also know the Federal taxes should be payed if you owe them, but how can I owe them at the end of the year, if the government itself says I don't make enough for our accounting company to do it like it all used to be done for anyone I ever worked for since I was 17?

I already have people who are interested in renting it at $1800/mo. Using the profit from the rent to roll into my new home payment to keep it low enough to continue saving money.

I'm doing really well in starting to become more aware of my finances and work on budgeting. As I was looking over my finances I realized I have enough money in my savings to technically pay off my entire credit card. I have about $2k in checking and $9k in savings. My credit card is about $8K. This is not my only debt as I do still have about $6k in student loans still and $2k in medical bills. I figured... since my credit card racks up the most interest (it's an Alaska Airlines credit card) would it be a smart financial choice to just get rid of my credit card debt all at once? Or would it be smarter to just continue paying monthly (maybe a little higher than required)? 
I guess I'm worried that draining my savings all at once might not be smart... but the thought of having so much debt freaks me out so much. 

Also once I do eventually pay off my card I plan to not use it except for emergencies. I've been good so far the last couple months of not adding any more expenses onto it! Any advice would help!",1727857093.0,1,5,1fub7o8

personalfinance,Worrying about my future,"Hi everyone - for a little background information I am a student currently enrolled at a major public university. My parents didn't have much saved up for my college, so every single year so far (3 years in), I have taken out a loan with a private loan company of around $23,000 per year. These interest rates have steadily gone up with each year, being 6,7, and my one for this year is currently above 10%. Additionally, I have 3 unsubsidized student loans from the government that are approximately $6,500 per year that are all around 6% interest rate. As it stands right now, my parents are the cosigners on these loans and are helping me pay the interest off on them, which also fills me with guilt.

As this year has started to take a toll on me mentally already one month in, it has also recently suddenly started to hit me with this overwhelming sensation of panic and dread that I will never be able to pay these loans back. I am already struggling with trying to find availabilities internship market, not to mention the fact that job prospects are down in my field. I was planning on attending graduate school, but I don't even know if the pay increase that people tell you comes with having a higher degree is going to outweigh the costs of paying for graduate school at this rate. Also, when my two younger siblings enter college next year and the year after that, I get anxiety even thinking about what the financial burden on my parents will look like. The new FAFSA change actually increases the EFC for students with siblings in college instead of decreasing it by half like it used to, and while this works out better for families with siblings more than 4 years across, it certainly doesn't help my family.

Overall, I am terrified that I will be stuck paying these loans off for the rest of my life. I can't even imagine how much money I will have to be pouring into this one aspect of my finances without even trying to plan to possibly get married to my boyfriend or have children in the future, or set aside money for a retirement/ROTH IRA.

Right now I honestly really truly just need to hear from people who have gone through this already or are going through this right now to see if it all magically does work out down the line or if I have kinda pushed myself into a corner here that I need to start working out from. I just want to know if maybe I am overthinking this and am just maybe too burnt out from school (which I probably am).",1727855322.0,1,0,1fuatnd

personalfinance,"Rebilling, Doctor Permanently Closed","I have had issues since my job switched our insurance carriers 2-3 years ago with the new company covering physical therapy visits. Earlier this year I finally connected with a representative in the new insurance company who is working on helping me. It turns out that my chiropractor's office used the wrong billing code which caused some of my physical therapy to not be covered. I went to separate offices for each service. My plan says each service is separate but this billing error caused chiropractic adjustments to count towards physical therapy. I have paid my doctors in full. When I paid my physical therapy bill, the lady in the billing office told me NOT to tell my insurance that the bill was paid on their end since I was still fighting to get them to cover the bills.

I found out today that my physical therapy office closed permanently while we are still trying to get the chiropractor's office to rebill and fix their codes.  
  
What will happen when and if my physical therapy visits are rebilled, especially if I am owed money? Can my claims be rebilled if the office is closed? Should I tell my insurance company that the physical therapy office closed?

personalfinance,I held a significantly more conservative portfolio than i should have for decades - now at 52 years old I calculated roughly how much it cost me to date and in the future,"ok so we all have our risk tolerance so take this how you will but i thought it was worthwhile to share. 

Brief background is that i am an aggressive saver, and have maxed out my 401K and Roth since long, long ago.  Good right?  Well, problem was, I read some advice somewhere as a young man, who knows what i was thinking, and attempted to keep a 70 stock/30 bond split and moved on with my life.  In hind-site this alone was WAY to conservative for my time horizon.  That was my first mistake.  My second mistake is never paying attention and turns out when i looked across my multiple accounts it was worse than that.   For the record, I had 33% Bonds, 34% US Stocks, 25% Intl Stocks, and 8% REITS.  (SO you could say 67% stocks I guess but not nearly as much US as I wish).   Not TERRIBLE. 

But considering my time horizon, this was not ideal and Do not make these mistakes. 

So I used a backtest Portfolio Modeler (portfolio visualizer) starting in 2015 when I had about $335K saved at the time as it was the farthest back i found a solid allocation.  OMG, it is truly depressing!  To give you idea of my most Aggressive model, a 90/10 split since just 2015, I currently have about $508K less in my portfolio.  

Then I used a retirement calculator to project forward. Even assuming I re balanced to much more conservative today, that amount then carried until 2050 using a very conservative 3% gain per year amounts to about $901K ""lost"".   If I use a more hopeful 6%, we are looking at $1.754 million over the course of my life.  Of course there are 100 variables like withdrawals, inflation, (not accounted for) and other things, but i just had a morbid curiosity. But i think its safe to say about a milly easy.

My mother (57F) is her sole caregiver. No certifications or qualifications for caregiving. She receives a pension ($1400/mo) that will decrease to $900/mo when she begins taking social security. She plans to take social security at age 62. Due to her being the primary caretaker, she cannot work unless it is remote and part-time.

They are located in Florida. Here’s some questions I have:

1. Can my mother receive benefits from the government for being the primary caregiver, and how does she apply for that?

2. Do I understand correctly that my grandmother can apply for SSI if her assets are under $2000, not including her residence, life insurance policies, and the 1 car under her name?

3. How do I check Medicaid eligibility for my mom? Is it free? She has no health insurance and says she doesn’t have the funds to pay a monthly premium.

I felt odd selecting an exact dollar amount since all I know is that I want my heloc for $225k but I don’t need to access the funds now. So, I confirmed with my lender that the funds wouldn’t be dispersed to me right away, as I don’t want to incur any payments or have any additional debt. I just want the HELOC available for when I do want to use it.

They said, “The full amount is paid to you at close. You can pay it back right away, and then you can draw on it or pay it back anytime. It is transferred, not wired, so it is an ACH transfer to send it back if that makes sense (no wire fee). Once you’ve paid it back, there is no payment until you choose to use it again in the future.”

Does this make sense? I didn’t realize the amount you requested was paid out in full then you pay it back to start the loan? I never understood that it worked that way, I thought it was just a revolving line of credit available to you when you need it.

investing,"Reality Check on Best Broker Fit For Me? Schwab, Fidelity or Interactive Brokers?","I have experience trading Forex and Commodities on Think or Swim 12 years ago. Didn't have time to keep doing it so put my money in real estate and been out of all the markets. Have time now to get back into trading. Never going to be a High Frequency Day Trader, but far from a passive investor. I've been dabbling in equities with Fidelity's platform and not impressed. They allow conditional orders but not in an OCO (such as one order is stop loss, other is a trailing stop loss triggered if price exceeds a certain value). I verified the other day Think or Swim can do this type of order. However I'm wondering long-term if I want to start short selling, resume Forex and/or Commodities trading or do Put/Call Options, am I better off going from trading on Fidelity to Interactive Brokers and use TradingView, instead of Schwab with Think or Swim?

A few key points:

I don't plan on trying to use my Broker as my bank account. So the fact Fidelity cash is automatically put in a money market fund and Schwab you have to manually buy/sell, is not a big deal to me.

I do like the fact with Fidelity, I can sell and immediately use the unsettled funds to buy with, without waiting for the sell order to settle in a couple days. This is a MUST for me.

I want fast, free ACH transfers. I can live without Zelle which Schwab has and Fidelity you can use Zelle indirectly (with pitiful limits) linking the Fidelity Debit card to Zelle. But I can't live with waiting more than 2 or 3 trading days for funds from a sale to be available for no-fee ACH transfer out, and the ACH transfer needs to be one business day MAX, better yet, same day if you put the transfer request in soon enough in the morning that day.

On ACH deposits I prefer to be able to trade with the funds immediately but can live with a reasonable clearance time, like 3-5 business days? Freezing funds for 8+ days is not necessarily a deal breaker but leaves a really bad taste in my mouth. I hate when the fraud measures get to such a paranoid level that it makes funds transfers/availability overly slow and cumbersome.

I want low hurdles on qualifying for margin account so I can short sell. I'm talking starting with just a mid 5-figure account deposit. Level 1 Options is find to start at that level. Not a deal breaker, but I prefer a broker where getting approval for Level 2 Options, Forex, and Commodities to be like qualifying for a mortgage and putting $250K plus into the account. I'm not really sensitive on the margin interest rate as I won't use the margin very often and/or for long periods.

I don't care about fractional shares. On Fidelity you can only put in the most simple orders on any fractional shares that are good for the day. You can't put in stop loss orders good til canceled. (Seems the fractional share stuff on Fidelity is really mainly good for passive investors that want to put a little money into something like Berkshire Hathaway and the likes.)



Given my goals/situation would do people see any big advantages to go Schwab with Think or Swim or Interactive Brokers with TradingView?

investing,Simple future bull case for pfizer,"The argument is simple.

The first main assumption is that ai in terms of value creation and capture in the pharma industry has not really arrived. The second assumption is that there will be huge renaissance of pharma with solving the biggest medical feats of our time like cancer due to the acceleration and capability of ai assisted therapeutic practices.

Pfizer is a leader in research and has the resources to be (one of) the winner-take-all companies of the potential ai value capture. I get it's a vague argument, but it's more of a philosophical claim that if ai in the next 10 years changes humans relationship with disease, who is most likely to benefit disproportionately? Probably the market leader wants to ensure they own this future exponential curve of ai expedited cures. 

Main counterpoint:

ai will in the long long term probably make it easier for smaller companies to compete because it will be so cheap to produce drugs.

When I initially started I backtested the two and saw a clear difference in the volatility of the “top 7” portfolio, with higher highs and lower lows compared to something like VOO, but also saw a much larger overall portfolio value over that period of time in the “top 7” portfolio. The top 7 portfolio has about a .64% dividend yield (probably less actually because I have SCHD and DGRO in there for dividends) compared to VOO’s yield of 1.31%. Is the higher volatility worth the lower yield? By sacrificing dividends am I stunting the compounding effects? Am I totally lost?!

investing,What are investors looking for when investing in AI startups,"We see lot of investments being made in AI related startups/products, but what I'm trying to understand is what are investors looking at when investing in AI startups.

The obvious answer would be that they are looking for a return on investment, but we see examples of investments being made in open source startups, like mistral, how did they secure more than $100M in their seed round while being partly open source (and I don't know how these AI startup plan to make return on investments, especially the open source ones (idk if APIs, ads and subscriptions are the only thing there))

Why do investors invest in open source (and even closed source) AI startups ? Are investors looking for talents ? Would they invest in a startup because it has many experienced AI scientists ? Or is it more the final product and the idea that matters more than the team itself ?

For example would investors invest in an AI startup that has many talents and well established scientists but without a clear breakthrough or great idea ?

And on the other hand, would they invest in the total opposite (startup with no known figures, no strong curriculum , not even computer scientists, but 'self taught' team with a breakthrough or a great idea + a prototype and a plan (given that it's possible to learn almost everything about AI online today and I think investors know this)) ?",1725447334.0,0,5,1f8q9xb

investing,What is meant by “cash on the sidelines?”,"This is a phrase that is commonly used by so many people in the industry and I’m curious as to its meaning. I understand the idea behind the phrase that if there is a lot of cash on the sidelines, it points to the fact that if there is a large increase in demand for stocks, there is a lot of cash to chase that demand, leading to a market rally.

My question, though, is more focused on the idea that for every buyer there is a seller - when I use cash to buy a security, I get the security and the seller gets my cash. Thus, the amount of cash in the system doesn’t change due to investment activity. So isn’t there always the same amount of cash on the sidelines? If so, why use this phrase as opposed to just talking about a possible increase in demand?

investing,I feel like I don't understand ETFs/Money Markets,"I have an account with Fidelity, and I keep around 10 grand liquid cash in it among my other holdings. This pays me around $42 a month because the money is held in SPAXX. I was looking into ETFs specifically SCHD and VIG but for the life of me I cannot sort out why I would ever invest in them over SPAXX. I feel like I *have* to be doing the math wrong, but SPAXX pays me $42 per-month, or around $128 per-quarter at a rate of around 4.96%. Meanwhile, SCHD (I picked up 10 shares out of curiosity) $0.82 per-share on June 26th at a rate of 3.35%. If I bought SCHD at $77.15 per-share at the end of May I'd have had 129 shares which would've netted me $105.78 or around $35.26 per-month.

So I guess my question is, why would anyone put anything in these funds versus SPAXX when the return seems better? Am I doing bad math? Is the market just really good for money market stuff at the moment? This is driving me up a wall trying to understand it.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: Ok, so what I'm getting so far, is that the main difference is that the interest on SPAXX is tied to the fed and so isn't as ""stable"" I guess is the word, as the return on the ETF investment, combined with the fact that the ETF as a security, will potentially increase in value on top of the dividends that it yields.

I recently learned about SGOV in a thread talking about emergency fund, which then lead to people saying 'it's as good as cash'.  Looking into it more, I'm not so sure, but maybe I'm missing something.

If i compare to a MM fund like SPAXX, SGOV provides .24% more return.  But because it only distributed dividends monthly, which means if you need to sell SGOV mid month, you will miss out on ALL the gains that month.  As SPAXX is paying 5%, it means I'd have to hold SGOV for ~24 months and/or sell on the exact correct days of the month, to make up for the potential loss.  This seems maybe fine for an emergency fund you might sell from once or twice a decade, but not as cash.

investing,HELOC vs Roth IRA contributions for investment property - buildable land. ,"
Edit: Land loan, NOT HELOC - sorry

My husband (53) and I (40) are considering buying 5 acres of buildable land for 70k with deeded lake access (1/2 mile from the property), which is also part of a unique nature preserve and protected development, including a 500 acre lake solely contained within the 2,000 acres of the Preserve. No public access or motorized craft. Common areas including gorgeous hiking trails with lake views. There is electric + high-speed internet.

This area is a truly unique outdoor destination, drawing visitors from near and far, within reasonable driving distance to major cities like Toronto, New York, Montreal, and Boston (Montreal is closest). We live 40 minutes from the location .. and it's an extremely easy drive. There is also a great little ski hill about 12 minutes from the location - and we love to ski.

We would really like to purchase the land with the idea that we start slowly, building a lean-to and using it for camping and leisure. We have a 4 and 5 year old and we'd like to have a place to go to with them.

Eventually (5-10 years) we would like to build a small 750-1200 sf cabin, which we would rent out for 30 day rentals (or shorter term to close friends and family, but we do not want to STR &amp; it's against the covenants, as well.) The location is commuting distance for local towns/small cities where there aren't great rental (or buying) options because it's a vacation destination, so people are always looking for nice options to live in the mid-term.

Previously, I have had good results buying and selling real estate, which yielded gains we probably will never have again in my lifetime, due to the crazy market. Currently, we have a reasonable mortgage and live in a beautiful old ""forever"" home that's almost fully renovated, with about 40% equity.

I have some savings and investments set aside to make this land purchase. However, I still need about 30k. I'm considering utilizing my Roth IRA contributions to make up this difference. I would still have money in my Roth (earnings), as well as my SIMPLE and IRA retirement accounts. (I also am the trustee and heir to a land trust through my family, which includes some farmland that we are under contract to lease for 50k/annually to a solar company, but that's just an aside as I don't consider it my own.)

Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips.

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion.

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

So let me know your thought what could be my next steps:

1. Invest some weekly amount into dividend etf and build a passive income base like this way.
2. Increase by the same amount my regular etf and just build wealth - and maybe later, when time comes, just lump sum some amount into dividend etf anc chill.

You see, I wander which option is more logical in like 20-30 yrs run - have few options (growth, dividend etc etfs) or just stick with wealth growth and don’t care about dividends, since growth is all we should seek, even in our later years.

Higher tax rates are coming, and sooner or later the government is going to target 401k's and IRA's. The old adage of ""tax deferred when you are working so you can withdraw it and be taxed at a lower rate later"" is likely not true.

personalfinance,401k Loan ACTUALLY makes sense here?,"I'm looking at a VA Loan and in this scenario I'm considering a 401k Loan to cover some of the down payment needed.

  
Before certain response come:

-I already have a VA loan so yes I NEED the down payment for this to work

-I am aware of the con's of a 401k loan, some are mitigated and seeing if this case might be appropriate



I currently bring home net $7.5K from work and $3.5K in VA benefits.  I'm maxing 401K w/ match, HSA, and ESPP. and saving 3.5K per month currently.



Just went under contract and originally was going to do 10% down on a $320,000 house and cash for closing costs.  This would leave me 20K for Emergencies on this and other property I have, as well as 6 months expenses.

PITI (w/PMI) is $1,990 (18.1% take home pay) at 6.125%

However, I can get a 5.5% VA for the same closing costs, but I MUST bring 18.5% due to my VA loan on my other property which is currently rented and locked in at a very sexy 2.25% interest rate.

Going VA would require one of the following:

1. all cash reserves under $5,000 after close

2. sell 25K from taxable brokerage account

3. take a 401k loan for 25K

  
while I could always do options 2 or 3 to access funds in an emergency, I'd rather just go one of those routes to start.

  
While not a guarantee I have very big bonuses in the near future (low 6 figures), and I will still be able to put away a minimum of $3,500.

  
some final notes about the 401k Loan for my program:

-even if employment is terminated, I can keep loan terms and not cause a taxable event

-can still make contributions and get employer match

-I have a 6 month grace period if I am forced to stop payments before I must reinitiate or take the penalty/taxes



If it will be paid off in well under a year, why shouldn't I do the 401k loan?

They based my rates on my driving history and all other factors pertaining me. My payment stayed the same every single month for all of those years. About 7 months or so ago SafeAuto merged into Direct Auto. I was advised they were merging over and sent a new packet with my policy information. After looking it over, nothing with my coverage had changed at all---but the price was going up significantly. I was told to keep my rate, to fill out the packet and send it back (to keep my regular rate). I mailed it back and got a direct email to send it through as well. I was advised packet was received but my rate was still going up. 

4 months later my payment goes down by a little bit. 6 month renewal mark is here and they are increasing it again. 

The direct auto rep I spoke with advised me the increase is due to factors (none of them pertaining to me) such as environmental factors in my area (I live in Ohio), car part costs and labor, medical costs, etc. 

I asked if I can get a copy or additional information with the rising costs so I can see why it's being raised. I was told firm and sternly ""No we dont do that."" 

MY BIG QUESTION---my costs increased once already due to those environmental factors and then went back down 4 months later (due to those SAME environmental factors, medical costs, parts and labor etc). I'm now being told those same environmental factors (that I can't receive proof or information on) have gone back up, causing my price to increase back to that same high amount.

Was working at a job for a short time almost a year ago that I had a 401a account with. I had to quit because I started school full time and they couldn't work around my schedule. As of today I have about \~$3,000 in the 401a account, so it's not much. Honestly, I would leave the money in the account to continue growing but I have no control over how it is being invested and as of now it's way too conservative (70% allocation to bonds) and I'd like to get it out of there so i can get it more diversified. I'm currently working part time, less than 20 hours a week and making minimum wage, so I'm at the lowest tax bracket that I can be at. I already have a Roth IRA open. My question is, should I rollover into the Roth IRA? From my knowledge, if I do I'll have to pay income taxes on the \~$3,000. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this. Or, should I open a new traditional IRA and rollover into this to keep the pre-tax advantages? I'm thinking that, because of my low tax bracket and the amount being so low (\~$3000), along with me being so young (24), this might be the best option since it will have a lot of time to grow and the Roth IRA advantages may outweigh the up front tax disadvantages. However, I'm not sure if my logic holds true or if i have anything wrong. Open to advice and would love to hear what you guys think I should do. Also, not sure if there are any other better options?

So we have new coverage and we are still set to have the roof replaced this coming week.

(Clarification: Since I don’t live in the United States, I will use approximate amounts in dollars.)

I have a debt of $600 on credit cards because I had to use them several times to make ends meet, and that amount has been increasing over the last year. I have a salary of $1,200 monthly and a stable job; my salary is increasing slowly, and it is highly likely that by December I will be earning more than I do now.

If I tackle this debt with my salary, I will have to rely on my credit cards again to survive until the end of the month, as I won’t have enough money.

I have an idea of how to solve it, but I need help to know if it’s a good idea or not.

My bank offers personal loans of up to $4,200, with terms ranging from 3 to 72 months, with interest rates between 71% and 74% annually. My idea is to take a loan for 12 months of $600. With this, I would have monthly payments of $82 for an entire year, totaling $997 by the end of the loan. This loan can be paid off without penalties within the first 180 days (i.e., the first 6 months of the loan), and my idea is to pay it off before that period when my financial situation improves.

Keep in mind that the term can be shorter or longer (as I mentioned at the beginning, between 3 and 72 months), and if the loan ends up being longer than 24 months, it can be paid off without fees before a quarter of the loan term has passed.

Is this a good idea? Do you have any other suggestions?

Im also a media lead at a church, and i get a stipend every month for gas for 100 bucks. 

Basically, I make about 500 a week. 

i pay my parents 200$ a month for my car (2021 Toyota corolla) and it is good on gas, around 35 MPG (however, when i buy groceries or food for my family they subtract this from my total car payment) typically only fill twice a month so my stipend from the church pretty much gives me free gas. 

How can i navigate this situation? i feel like I'm throwing my money into a black hole sometimes, only for my debt to get bigger. i want to take the most logical and least expensive approach to fixing this issue. i dont have any property for a line of credit to get me out of this.

personalfinance,Take out HELOC or sell stocks to finance real estate investment,"
I'm in the process of acquiring two rental properties. Here's the breakdown:

Deal 1:

2 unit valued at 355k that I'm buying for $270.  I know the owner and he's getting a divorce so I'm getting a good off-market price.

Down-payment + closing costs is $80k.  Both units are occupied and cash flows 1k per month. There's also a studio in the back that needs to be refinished which will bring in an additional 800 per month once completed.

Deal 2:

4 unit valued at 250k that I'm getting for $230k.  2 of the units are occupied with tenants that want to stay.  Closing costs will be 63k.  Once fully rented, it will cash flow 2 to 2.5k per month.

Neither units really need any work but may sink in 5k to paint interiors plus boost curb appeal of both properties.

My fiances:


90k liquid cash

126k in stock market

86k in IRA

8.5k in crpyto

2.7k in silver

2.6k mortgage payment on a house I have ~250k in equity

Own a double directly next door to deal #1 that cash flows 1.1k per month and have ~150k in equity

Own a commercial building outright that cash flows 1k per month valued at 120k

4 cars worth a combined 80k with zero payments.  


I'm in my low to mid 30s with no kids or wife and make a steady 100kish per year from my business. Currently have 1M net worth with 700k tied in assets + equity 

I plan on using 80k of my liquid money for the down payment on the first house.  My stocks have done well and I have about 25% of my holdings in one stock I'm up 100% up on (I have long term conviction with this stock, but it is also currently up 7x from its lows from 2 years ago).

To finance the 2nd deal, I have two options:

Option A:

Sell off 52k from stock portfolio + all my crypto + silver.  I will have to pay capital gains, but it won't be too bad considering I have some loser stocks too.  I would trim 10% of the main tech stock I own as well as sell my positions in other stocks I don't care as much about to finance the 63k down payment for deal #2.  This would leave me with about 75k in my personal stock portfolio

In 2022, I watched my stock portfolio to go from 190k down to 80k due to a really bad year in my tech focused portfolio.  Currently,  I'm up 53% or 71k all-time.


Option B:

Take out a heloc (which is something I've never done before) on my primary residence for 65k at a rate of 3.99% for the first year.  If I go this route, I'd try to use all of my combined rental income + any money I would've invested in stocks thru 2025 to pay off the heloc the first year.

I am really wanting to get a reliable car that i am going to be able to drive for the next 20 years until i burn it into the ground too. There are a number of 2024 Toyota Corolla’s at a dealership near me with around 20k miles listed for 22-23k that are certified pre owned with a warranty cooked in. I am hoping to negotiate that price down to 20k or less. I also have about 7k i feel comfortable putting towards it. Assume after taxes/fees. aiming for a loan of about $15,000. 

Income is 52k a year, rent is $750. I currently have about 12k in savings (including the aforementioned 7k i feel comfortable with putting towards the car). I’ve been putting about $600-700 a month into a hysa a month for about the past two years (not counting 401k contributions). I have 10k in student loans at 3.98% interest, will have $0.00 payments for at least the next year on those and not sure what they look like after that. No other debt. Credit score is in the 770s. Through the CU i work for (assuming i get approved) I’d get a rate of 6.49% on a 60 month loan. I’d ideally like to not have a loan where I work, but it’s an option of the dealer rates suck. The car payment would be take from the money i put into savings currently. looking at how to rework my budget to cut back in other places too.

would this be a stupid idea??? I’d obviously try to pay it off sooner than 60 months. but the interest rate is the same for up to 60 months. It feels really scary to be cutting how much i put into savings by half but also i really really want a reliable car that is going to last me. ",1727824911.0,6,15,1fu2617

personalfinance,Roth Conversion 5 year rule when you already have a Roth and are over 59.5,"Let’s say someone is considering taking their sizeable traditional IRA and converting to a Roth and then immediately starting distributions. He’s in his late 60s. He’s had a small Roth open for over 5 years. 

Main two questions:
1- since he has a small Roth that’s been open for more than 5 years does this even apply to him? The thing that’s giving me pause here is that each Roth conversion has its own 5-year waiting period, so I would think that if having ANY Roth open for 5 years meets the requirement, it wouldn’t make sense for subsequent conversions to have their own waiting period since that would “automatically” be met. 
2- if it does apply, how is he taxed? My understanding is that the tax only applies to earnings made after the conversion. So if it’s worth $5m at the time of conversion, as long as he doesn’t take out more than $5m before 5 years is up, he’s fine.

Since I'm 24 years old, finances are my top priority right now because I'm looking to buy a property.

It occurred to me to ask if there's an option for profit sharing (a payout model, for example, annually) plus a salary, as I believe the project has great potential in the market, but I don't know how these things work. I would actually prefer to focus on one job rather than juggling two, but I don't want to leave my stable job just like that.

To mention a few more things:

* The project is nearing completion, and based on my estimate, it should go live in about 6 months. It would start generating revenue immediately since there are already interested clients.
* I’m quite important to him as I complete everything, and he really values me (he's a great guy, so I give it 110%).

personalfinance,What to do with excess cash: put toward mortgage or invest?,"Hi everybody, looking for some input or suggestions on what to do with a bunch of cash I have just sitting in the bank.

I am a single 33M living in Colorado, own a house worth \~$440K which I owe about $340K on, with a rate of 6.25%. No other debts. Monthly mortgage pmt (including taxes, insurance and interest) is \~$2400. My annual gross income is $190K-200K or so.

I have about $100K in the bank just sitting there and I know I need to do something more productive with those funds. I have about $360K or so in retirement funds across a Roth IRA and a 401K.

For the last two months I've been throwing an add'l $1K per month at my mortgage principal.

I've considered taking \~$40-50K and just putting that toward my mortgage principal which I believe would save alot of interest and also reduce significantly the time it'll take to repay the loan.

I'm in a bit of a panic here and could really use some advice. I'm finalizing my 2023 taxes (I got an extension) using TurboTax like I do every year. Usually, it's pretty smooth sailing, but this time around, I'm looking at some numbers that are freaking me out.

Here's the deal:

* **My state tax bill is showing up as $3,600** 
* **Meanwhile, my federal refund is a whopping... $28** 

Is this normal? Because it sure doesn't feel normal to me. I can't shake the feeling that something's gone wrong here, but I'm not sure what.

To make matters worse, I was laid off earlier this year, so this potential tax bill is hitting at the worst possible time. I literally can't afford this right now.

I'm thinking about using one of those TurboTax agent assistance features. Has anyone tried these? Are they worth it? I'm hoping maybe an agent could better spot an issue if there is one.

personalfinance,suspicion my company actively seeking to be acquired. should i hold or sell my vested RSUs before any potential acquisition?,"publicly traded company. stock is doing really well in the last 6 months but has been relatively consistent growth for the last 7 years.  normally when my RSUs vest i sell and buy SPY. got about $36K left to vest between now and Nov 2027. 

i am sensing/observing the early signs of a company looking for acquisition without like, hard proof. a hiring decision here, an exec push for streamlining budgets, basically a lot of small moves to trim the fat on the books to attract buyers. (no i won’t say the company name). i could be chasing windmills here but i doubt any serious movement will occur in the next year or so, if at all. 

anyways i know that payout for unvested RSUs will depend on the acquisition deal. might not even see the value of any unvested stock. but im curious if there is an advantage to holding onto the vested stock in the event my company is acquired? I’m guessing the acquisition will result in a net increase in the stock value compared to whatever the market value is for that point in time. i’m uneasy with holding onto so much single stock for a long period of time, but would consider holding if there’s a general consensus that the value of the vested stock at acquisition is going to be higher than at market. (like is it typical to see a 1-5% increase in the sale cost for acquisitions or is it more like .01% etc etc)

also another thing, is employee stock purchase plans too. is there a stronger advantage to invest here with the potential of an acquisition vs my vested RSUs or is it the same considerations?

The dealership guy called me up today after I asked about it and he said his finance guy recommended I pay for the $1000 coverage for one month for the bank to see, then switch back to $2500 coverage. That sounds really sketchy and like it would screw me over. Is this a legitimate thing that won't bite me in the ass? Sounds like it'll bite me in the ass.

I’m in a weird situation and I need some guidance. For context, my husband is a 1099 worker, so he has private insurance. I’m a 26 y/o and was just on my mom’s insurance until the end of July. 

I just gave birth to my son on July 22nd, and since I was under my mom’s insurance, they won’t cover his stay. My husband did put our son on his private insurance about 2 days after his birth.

We received mail today that stated my insurance wouldn’t cover his portion of the bill, but we hadn’t given them my husband’s insurance yet. They sent another piece of mail that says we will owe $8,962.00 since insurance wasn’t covered. 

Of course, my husband called his insurance and they’re stating that they won’t backdate the insurance to when our son was born. But how are we supposed to get insurance for a baby that didn’t even have a name, birth certificate, or SSN, and one where we didn’t know when he’d be born. 

Aren’t they automatically supposed to cover his birth as long as he was added to insurance within 30 days of the birth? Google says it’s automatic under the mother’s insurance (why not also father?), but since I was under my mom’s, it won’t cover.

personalfinance,Credit Line Suddenly Slashed...,"Long story short: have been working to increase my available credit and score slowly over the last 1.5years. Second baby and Covid hit my credit pretty hard. Since then its been penny pinching, no vacations, no restaurants, etc., The process was going as it should and this summer I was able to apply for a personal loan to pay down two Chase credit cards and get a lower interest rate. Great! and my credit utilization looked better. 

Things were looking up and the option of refinancing the house this fall when rates go down was attractive - we've put a lot of work into the house since 2018 and the property value has skyrocketed. A small portion of this would go towards the remaining cc debt - about $13k.

On September 22nd Chase sent one of their letters saying my credit line had been decreased - on the two cards I just paid down with a personal loan. They cut around $10k … smashing my available credit and plummeting my score. After the credit line decrease, those cards are almost maxed out and useless.

I called them on the 30th to talk about any reinstatement options to no avail. No compromises or anything, just ""sorry, there is nothing we can do"". Score dropped down to 650-670 with a 63% utilization rate.

personalfinance,Debt management plan effect on spouse's credit ,"Hi all, I tried to search the sub but didn't find anything that fit my situation and Google searches are also coming up mostly empty.

The TL;DR is this: 

If I enroll credit card and personal loan accounts that are solely in my name in a debt management plan, will that show up or otherwise negatively impact my spouses credit in any way?

The long version:

My situation is this: I have high income and high debt my wife is a full time student again so no income but also quite a bit less debt, especially monthly payment wise since her past student loans are deferred for the next 3-4 years while she finishes her program. 

Our debt is almost entirely separate. We have no joint credit cards, the only joint loan is my vehicle which is a monthly payment of $550 with about 3 years and  $23k total remaining.

Additionally, she is very responsible with money. So step 1 is I'm basically turning all financial responsibility to her.

My debt and financial responsibility on the other hand is bad. 1 personal loan and 1 credit card in collections. Another personal loan and several other credit cards that are current. Plus a checking account that's -$2k. All together it's about $15k in collections and another $35k in current unsecured debt. I also have ~$140k in student loans that I haven't been making any payment on during the ramp up year. 

I discussed this with my wife so it isn't hidden, though she didn't know the full extent until recently. And with my income I think we could make a plan to pay it off on our own over several years, but considering my credit is already bad I want to do a debt management plan to cut the interest and also because I basically don't trust myself to not get into this same situation again, considering at the end of the day our income is currently still solely in my control while she's a student. I think the debt management plan and counseling will really help both from a practical perspective of paying off the debt I have and from a counseling perspective of setting me up to better handle finances going forward. My only concern is that it could potentially impact her credit, which is good. Currently that good credit isn't useful since she has no sole income and to include my income we also need to include my terrible credit. But once she's done with school and has her own income again, I don't want to affect her ability to get credit while I'm still fixing mine.

investing,How to Actually Rebalance a Portfolio - 23F Beginner ,"Hello,

I am a 23F engineer that started working full time about a year ago. I have some money from college because I was fortunate enough to be paid to go to college &amp; am able to add to that amount regularly. 

I know I need a Growth Portfolio (because I’m young), &amp; the balance I found was 50% large cap, 11% mid cap, 7% small cap, 15% non US developer market equity, 6% emerging market equity, 9% alternative investments, 2% cash/ cash alternatives. Outside of this amount, I’ve been told that I need to maintain 6 months living expenses in cash to be prepared for any sort of emergency such as a lay off. I have this already set aside. Does this balance make sense? Is 6 months of living expenses set aside too much even if it would just be in a cash alternative money market in a brokerage account?

Additionally, is it suitable for each percentage of the portfolio to be a money market/ multiple money markets with good Morningstar ratings that fit the sub-categories of “large cap”, “mid cap”, etc. or am I completely on the wrong track? Any sort of advice or guidance is welcome. I haven’t been able to find anything that spells out what people actually invest in (other than stocks) to make their portfolios meet the ideal mix for whatever their financial goals are &amp; I’m opposed to stocks until I become more familiar and comfortable with investing. 

Right now I have everything in cash/ cash alternatives and worry about diving in if this isn’t a good approach because I don’t want to lose all of my money immediately by making rash decisions. However, every day I feel stressed knowing I’m wasting time not making a move but I am scared of losing the money I do have, so thank you in advance for your time &amp; knowledge!",1725305448.0,1,3,1f7fm08

Hat in hand here, tail between my legs, asking for a bit of advice.

A while back circa 2017, I started dabbling with RH. Come 2019 I have about 23k in it. The bubble of March 2021 came and I thought I was on top of the world. 

I learnt a valuable lesson there. When you’re up over 100%, take the money and run you fool.

It started to dip, and I told myself be patient. It would bounce back. Still way up at this point, I could have taken a very decent profit. It dipped more; I did nothing. Around the beginning of 2022 I started having some problems in my personal life. My relationship wasn’t going well, and I fell into a deep depression. I stopped looking at RH entirely.

I cant remember when I first looked again and saw the carnage. It was over a year ago. Perhaps I’ve been in a bit of denial about it. I’m about 21k down in total, and also lost about 10k on E*TRADE.

investing,Have you seen the Reddit ads for “Basic Capital”?,"I checked out their website and still trying to figure out how it supposedly works.

Is it basically supposed to allow you to take out a mortgage (with down payment, etc.), but instead of buying a house with it - you use the money to invest in the index ETFs? 

And the “mortgage payments” are backloaded so that most of the principle and interest gets paid back toward the end of the term (to maximize the compounding effect of earlier returns)?

And if it all goes to $0 you’re protected through bankruptcy - so you won’t be at risk of having to use personal funds outside the program to pay back the “mortgage”?

Basic Capital facilitates all this by lining up the “mortgage lenders” for you, and setting up the bankruptcy protected entity through which you invest.

And then they make money by charging a monthly fee for this service.

That’s about it as best I can figure, but the website is not super clear about it and want to make sure I’m understanding.

And, if this is what it is… what do you think? I guess the idea is that the historically superior index ETF returns, combined with the leverage associated with the “mortgage,” will pretty much guarantee returns significantly greater than the sum of the mortgage payments? And also greater than simply investing your un-leveraged funds in the same ETF?",1725290065.0,0,14,1f797y7

investing,Asset location - move gold/silver to taxable account?,"I currently own the following gold/silver etf's that hold physical metal and miner stocks in the accounts as noted-

iau - physical gold - Roth  
sil -silver mining stocks - Roth  
iau - physical gold - Traditional IRA  
sivr- physical silver - Traditional IRA

I am thinking that it will be better to have something with an expected higher long term return (stock fund) in the Roth instead of gold/silver to take advantage of the tax free account. With that in mind, I am planning to sell iau and sil and buy a stock fund in the Roth account. To maintain, the same allocation to gold/silver, I will then purchase gold/silver in a taxable account.

In the traditional IRA, I am thinking to sell iau and sivr and purchase a bond fund after reading a traditional IRA is a good location for bonds from an asset location standpoint. I would also purchase an equivalent amount of gold/silver in a taxable account to maintain current allocation levels.

If both or either of the above moves makes sense, I am planning to buy gold and silver miners in the taxable account to take advantage of the capital gain rate vs collectible rate that would be taxed on an etf that holds physical gold or silver. I have read that you can get similar diversification effects from holding a smaller amount of gold/silver miners as they tend to move to a greater degree than the physical metals. If this is the case, I may not purchase as much of the miners in the taxable account that I previously held in my Roth/Traditional IRA accounts.

Fidelity says it’s an allocation amount of 81% domestic, 17% foreign and 1% bonds.

Some background on my choices..I know there’s some overlap bc I essentially have VTI with two stocks but I invested in the S&amp;p500 first and later decided I wanted some more market exposure so I got FSMAX. I got the FXNAX because I read about the 3 fund portfolio which was initial goal but after some more research realized I don’t need bonds right now because I’m young. So, I stopped contributing to it to lower its amount in my portfolio and only get the dividends reinvested. I got VBR because when I had less stocks I thought it might help getting small cap exposure. I know it has the potential for better rewards because if those companies do well and I can handle volatility right now.

","Most investors don’t like precious metals as an investment and rightfully so they're not ideal for wealth building, but useful for wealth preservation (a hedge against inflation).

Downsides to gold/silver its not as liquid as cash (this can be viewed as a plus since you'd have to transfer it into cash first - selling to a coin shop). Also you wouldn't stash 3-6 months expenses in cash in your home it would be in a savings account (theft, fire, or other unpredictable pitfalls) so doesn't particularly make sense to stash 3-6 months of expenses in gold/silver for the same reasons you wouldn't stash that much cash outside of a savings account.

Mom has about $250k invested in mutual funds and $30k cash. Dad has slightly less with just $150k in cash and another $150k in retirement scheme by government. However, both have assets in agricultural land that round about $500k total. No debts. House is paid off and has about $600k in value. We live a low profile lifestyle, nothing flashy.

At this moment, I have the following retirement accounts with the final amount in them, respectively (This excludes Social Security Benefits and Pensions):

1. **401k**: $1.5M
2. **Roth IRA**: $1.2M
3. **Taxable Brokerage Account**: $650k

There are a couple things to consider for each account:

1. **401k**: RMDs won't kick-in until I turn 73. I'm considered in the high income bracket with $1.5M, meaning I'll probably pay more taxes if I don't make the RMDs (From my understanding). So, I'll probably start doing Roth Conversions (10%) from my 401k into my Roth IRA and pay the taxes when I turn 73.
2. **Taxable Brokerage Account**: I'm unsure as to what to do with this account. I understand this account doesn't have RMDs, so one can hold it as long as one wishes and just continue to pay the dividends and interests. But, I may just consider doing a Roth Conversion into my Roth IRA. Would that be wise? And would think a Roth Conversion would be taxed as long-term capital gains (20% max) or ordinary income tax?
3. **Roth IRA**: With $1.2M, I'm thinking this account will be my main account to withdraw from, as I'm adding more funds from both my 401k and taxable account via Roth Conversion -- especially when there's no RMDs for post-tax accounts.

I've got a Robinhood account and had invested about half of it in index funds and the like to grow it a bit while it sits there.

I also have a 4.5 percent APY account at SoFi I could put it in instead, what do you think is a better option?

Stocks are riskier but could make me more money, while the savings makes me less but is consistent the way it is.

What would you guys recommend?

Please don't flame me in the comments I'm just trying to learn my way in the world ",1725216108.0,32,31,1f6lp7p

investing,Investing in Belgium how to do it better?,"Hallo fellow investers,
I am from Belgium and i Wanne start being serieus about investing and building wealth. I feel like it's hard here to invest en build something big. 

I invest in EFT's atm around 100 dollars a mounth. Next year i am doing more. So that's easy just every mounth in the same EFT's and let thé compounding do it's work. If i do this until my pension thats around 500000.

But i Wanne do more. I looked up real estate bcz you hear everywhere thats where they money is. Then i look at thé numbers and it's really really hard to do real estate in Belgium. So average pay is around 2400 after tax. Thé average home is around 328.000. then you pay around 1300-1400 a mounth on morgage. Also you need around 60.000 on your bank to be approved for a loan. If you Wanne buy another property to Rent out you need to have around 100.000 because you already have a property And i don't have that kind of money. 

I also save for my pension that's around 1200 a year max. In a fixed saving account specialy for pension. We don't have a 401k or something like that. You need to save for your pension all by yourself. My parents didnt Tell me all of this and because of this i started investing and saving at 25 and not 18. 

I can start investing in crypto but i dont like the market of that. 

So i don't know know what more i can do to invest and make more money. You van start a side husle in Belgium but you can make max 12k a year without paying taxes.

investing,Tax efficient investments for taxable brokerage account?,"Just generally. I’ve read numerous articles and they’re pretty vague. They do name a couple types of investments, but I’m still unsure. My worry or main concern is wanting to know what kind of investments should I make that can avoid low occurrences or trigger less taxable events (e.g., dividends and interests). And to generally avoid a huge tax bill. And this will most likely be a long-term investment, so won’t take anything out until I reach retirement age.

investing,Does a dividend focused investor need a significant investment in bonds for diversification? ,"Relatively experienced investor here. Have been thinking about this since I watched a video comparing portfolios with different allocations of equities/bonds (for example 60/40 vs 50/50) and their historical returns. 

I find a lot to like about the dividend snowball strategy (big thing for me is not having to sell anything to generate income) and while I have some growth positions I would say I'm primarily focused on dividends and minimizing risk of loss. 

Since dividend stocks tend to be larger ""safer"" companies in ""safer"" industries, does it make sense to worry as much about balancing with bonds as if I were growth-focused with my equities?

### **Investment Plan Using Fidelity Brokerage**

#### **1. Account Setup and Initial Funding**

- **Open a Fidelity IRA Brokerage Account**: Ensure you have an IRA brokerage account with Fidelity. If you don’t have one, you can open it online and select either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your retirement goals.
- **Fund Your Account**: Transfer or deposit the initial amount of $250,000 into your Fidelity IRA account. This will be the capital used for executing the investment strategy.

#### **2. Understand the Investment Strategy**

- **Investment Strategy**:
  - **Buy on SPY Drops**:
    - **0.5% Drop**: Invest $5,000
    - **1% Drop**: Invest $10,000
    - **2% Drop**: Invest $20,000
    - **3% Drop or More**: Invest $40,000
  - **Reinvestment Protocol**: Once your portfolio grows by 15%, sell all holdings and reinvest the total amount during the next market dip.
  - **Objective**: This strategy aims to capitalize on market volatility by investing more aggressively during larger market dips and frequently compounding gains.

#### **3. Set Up Alerts and Monitor SPY Performance**

- **Set Up Alerts**:
  - Use Fidelity’s alert system to set up notifications for SPY price changes. Create alerts for drops of **0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3%** to get notified when to consider making a trade.
- **Monitor SPY Performance**:
  - Regularly check SPY's daily performance using Fidelity’s platform or financial news. Fidelity provides real-time market data and research tools to monitor market conditions.

  - **When Alert is Triggered for a 0.5% Drop**:
    1. Log in to your Fidelity IRA brokerage account.
    2. Navigate to the **Trading** section.
    3. Search for SPY and prepare a **buy order** for $5,000 worth of SPY shares.
    4. Choose **Order Type**: Market order (for immediate execution) or limit order (to set a specific price).
    5. Confirm and execute the trade.
  - **When Alert is Triggered for a 1% Drop**:
    1. Repeat the steps above but buy $10,000 worth of SPY.
  - **When Alert is Triggered for a 2% Drop**:
    1. Repeat the steps above but buy $20,000 worth of SPY.
  - **When Alert is Triggered for a 3% Drop or More**:
    1. Repeat the steps above but buy $40,000 worth of SPY.

    - **Date of Investment**
    - **SPY Price at Investment**

    - **Shares Purchased**
  - Maintain a log of each investment and monitor the portfolio's overall growth.
  
- **Reinvestment Strategy**:

    2. Enter the trade details:
       - **Action**: Sell All
       - **Order Type**: Market order or limit order.
    3. Confirm and execute the sell order.
  - **Reinvest Gains**:
    - After selling, reinvest the new total amount during the next eligible market dip using the same strategy.

#### **6. Maintain a Disciplined Approach**

- **Stay Disciplined**: Adhere strictly to the investment and reinvestment criteria. Avoid emotional decisions based on market news or sentiment.
- **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review the strategy’s performance (quarterly or annually). Adjust the investment amounts or growth thresholds if market conditions change significantly or based on personal risk tolerance.

#### **7. Risk Management**

- **No Stop-Loss Mechanism**: This strategy doesn’t include a stop-loss to allow for full participation in market recoveries. Be prepared for potential drawdowns.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure this strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor if needed.

### **Example of Investment Plan Execution Over 10 Years**

**Initial Investment**: $250,000  
**Trading Example**:
- **First Year**:
  - SPY drops 0.5%: Invest $5,000
  - SPY drops 1% later: Invest $10,000
  - SPY drops 2% later: Invest $20,000
  - SPY drops 3% or more: Invest $40,000
- **Portfolio Grows by 15%**: Sell all holdings.
- **Reinvest**: Use the same criteria to reinvest with the new total.

**Repeat the Cycle**: Over 10 years, you would have executed 1,257 cycles of buying and selling according to the rules, achieving significant returns through disciplined execution.

### **Benefits of Using Fidelity for This Strategy**

- **User-Friendly Platform**: Fidelity offers a robust trading platform with easy-to-use tools for monitoring, trading, and managing investments.

This approach requires discipline, regular monitoring, and adherence to the strategy rules to achieve the desired outcomes.

My situation currently: I'm in my late 30s, and I have and fully fund and max out both my 401k and Roth IRA for the last 8 years. Both portfolios are total broad markets for both US and ex-US equities (TDF 2065 and FSKAX &amp; FTIHX, respectively).

By the end of 30-35 years, I'll most likely have somewhere between $1-$1.5M in both my 401k and Roth IRA, and be just slightly above $1M in my taxable brokerage account. My questions:

1. Should I worry about VT and paying for tax on it's dividend/interest payments in my taxable brokerage account, overtime?
2. Is the order of withdrawing best to go with tax-deferred accounts (401k), taxable brokerage account, then tax-advantage accounts (Roth IRA)? Or, would it better to prioritize accounts to withdraw from that doesn't give you a big tax bill during the early days of my retirement?
3.

We get 5% COLA and 0-15% incentives every year (but I will not rely on the incentives as it depends on everyone hitting a benchmark) that I plan to also put in 457b as long as my current budget could afford living expenses. TDFs perform more or less the same (~15% 1YR, ~4% 3YR, ~10% 5YR). I plan to start investing 10% of my net towards taxable brokerage instead of keeping in HYSA, possibly actively manage this and some of my retirement accounts. 

Now, here are my questions:
1. I want to rollover my 401k to simplify a bit and save on expense ratio. Should I rollover this to brokerage that manages my 457b and choose TDF? Or would it be better to rollover to Fidelity, buy VOO and chill?  Is this wise considering my age?

2. I’m undecided where to invest $7k in Roth IRA. I was thinking VOO and chill too. Is this wise considering my age? Or FZROX maybe?

3. Should I do anything with my TDFs with FidelityGo Trad IRA and 457b? I was thinking of leaving  these alone to leverage my VOO and chill plans.
 
4. Will I able to catchup? Should I put more towards retirement and less towards taxable brokerage account? I know plans could change but for now, I see myself working until at least 67 and retiring in a LCOL country. 

5. I want to put 10% in taxable brokerage to save up for short-term plans (maybe down payment for a house 5-10 years from now). Then VOO and chill too?

6. Am I oversimplifying? Should I diversify? I do plan to include bonds and/or dividend funds when I’m getting closer to retirement. 

7. Any other advice? 

Please let me know if any of these are sensible plans. Otherwise, let me know what I can do better. And thank you all!",1725111456.0,0,14,1f5ngq3
investing,Is the Roth IRA income limit based on the previous year tax return?,"For example, if my 2023 taxes show that we are under the household income limit for Roth IRA, can we contribute in 2024?

investing,Nvidia’s massive stock buyback,"From MarketWatch. 

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-buyback-plan-is-one-of-the-biggest-of-2024-is-that-a-good-thing-9beba5c5?mod=djem_mwnafterbell

&gt; The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That’s double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago

&gt; Looking beyond the year, Nvidia’s announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia’s market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.

I tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you’re spiraling down in the dumpster, there’s really no need to buy back— especially if you believe this is the High Point and it’s only going down from here.

Nvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow

But as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it’s gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line.

It’s in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It’s never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn’t destroy competition. 

So they’ve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.

However, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It’s noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that’s good news for them because they’ll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.

So in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.  

OR they feel they aren’t gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price.

Either way it’s good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there’s so much money and the scale is so vast that it’s hard to wrap my head around. 

If they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it’s astounding how much money they would’ve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.

Obviously, companies of this size don’t move that fast and they aren’t playing a shell game. So it’s merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would’ve created out of a blip.

Lots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I’m having a tough time seeing through it. 

In the past, they haven’t been a really savvy financial company. They’re not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They’ve just been “boring” R&amp;D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. 

The stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn’t fit who they’ve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they’re 3000 or 100? I suppose it’s nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn’t gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don’t really see the point.

As I’ve said, there’s a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.

I like to think it’s optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.

That’s my hope anyways.

Instead of diverting e.g. 1k$ towards a Roth IRA/401K/Taxable account/529/HSA you pay an extra 1K$+ on your mortgage e.g. 30 year fixed 5% interest, you essentially ""lost"" 5% compared if you were to make 10% on index funds in your retirement/ taxable account. 

While one could argue you gain equity when your house increases in value, it never becomes ""realized"" if you never sell however it's a hedge against inflation/ living costs since everyone needs a place to live and renting over long term will always be more expensive than buying since it exists to make profit for the landlord.

I expect markets to crash and lending conditions to ease next year and wanted recommendations on good loans to take out to use as working capital.

investing,Does this strategy have some holes that I don't know about?,"Hello all, I am only 20 years old and I am currently in the beginning of my investment journey, so just be wary if I'm making some hella stupid comments.

I am very much attracted to the idea of passive income, and fairly soon may be coming into a big check of around $80,000+, but keeping the number on the lower end to be safe. As I don't have any debts or large outstanding bills to pay (mainly just rent, utilities, food, insurance; car is paid off), I'm planning on likely investing the entire $80,000+ around when I get it. Which is where the first question comes in lol, is just me saying that a dumb thing? Should I slowly invest that amount over time, or wait for a golden opportunity to dump all of it, etc.

Secondly, and mainly, would splitting this investment up (maybe 70/30) into JEPI and JEPQ be a really bad/inefficient idea for someone just looking for immediate passive income to supplement their earnings, just to make life a little easier? I do fully understand that my total return would be higher placed into something like VOO overall, and since I am 20 and should probably be accumulating instead of looking for passive income, but that's not really what I'm asking for/not what I think is best for my personal situation. I'm just looking for the peace of mind of being able to pay for rent/food and not have to be stressed about trying to work all the time, or having to manage my portfolio in order to access the earnings it entitles me to. I would still plan on reinvesting dividends/buying more shares when my budget allows, and I also do have a Roth IRA consisting mainly of Vanguard ETFs that I put into occasionally just so I'm not totally missing out on total gains when it comes time to retire, but not what I'm really concerned about rn.

Does this strategy have a lot of holes in it (for the purposes I'm interested in it for) or any substantial potential to collapse and just fuck me over entirely? I have a pretty good understanding of how covered calls work, and how these ETFs can offer me downside protection at the cost of upside potential (+ income), which also leads me to mention that I am also very interested in the NEOS SPYI and QQQI ETFs, but do subscribe to the belief that there real isn't free lunch around here and the seemingly objectively better numbers overall worry me a little, and the fund hasn't been around long enough to really tell, so I think JEPI and JEPQ fit my low risk mindset a little better.

Do these questions make sense, and would this strategy (reliably) generate me monthly income with some upside potential and downside protection (which is basically my portfolio elevator pitch)? Or am I in over my head and need to heavily reevaluate how I invest this money, or otherwise is this investment just overall *riskier* than it seems in my head?

personalfinance,Newly Engaged and 10 Years Behind in Retirement Savings—How Do I Catch Up?,"(second account because I’d like to keep my identity private.)  
  
Hey everyone,

I recently got engaged, and my fiancé is about 10 years ahead of me in retirement savings. The first thing we did was start a joint savings account, each contributing $2,500 for a total of $5k to kickstart our safety fund. Now, I’m determined to get serious about my finances to ensure we’re both set up for a strong future together.

**Here’s where I’m at right now:**

* $65K salary
* 750 credit score
* She bought the house we live in just before we started dating for $200k at an incredible 2.0% interest rate (yeah, crazy low—props to her!). I contribute $750 a month toward rent and living expenses.
* Around $4-5k in credit card debt split between two cards:
   * Citi x2 Points ($1k balance) for everyday purchases and points—paid off in full every month in two payments.
   * AMEX ($3.3k balance at 29% APR) with monthly payments of $250.
* $24k total credit limit
* No student loans, no car payment
* $10k in checking
* $16k in a 3.6% APY savings account
* Just opened a Roth IRA with $500 monthly deposits

I’m pretty clueless when it comes to investing or the stock market, so I’d love any advice on what my next steps should be. How can I make the most of what I have now and set us up for long-term financial success?

personalfinance,Seeking Advice on Cash Flow Management and Debt Strategy,"Good day, everyone!

I’m a recent graduate (24M) who just landed a job with an income nearly double what I’ve earned before. I’m married with two children, and we currently rent in New Mexico, where the cost of living is moderately low.

I'm looking for feedback on my cash flow management and guidance on a few financial decisions I’m facing. Here’s a breakdown of my current situation:

# Monthly Income: $4,769.60

**Allocations:**

* **529 Contributions:** $133.55 (2.8%)
* **Employee Benefits:** $333.87 (\~7%) (includes family health care and HSA)
* **Personal Spending:** $238.48 (5%) *This is for no-questions-asked spending that my wife and I deposit onto our own separate debit cards. My wife also makes a side income, which she adds to that card, giving us both more flexible spending.*
* **401(k):** $238.48 (5%) (100% matched)
* **Roth IRA:** $238.48 (5%)
* **Emergency Fund:** $715.44 (15%)
* **Rent:** $1,192.40 (25%)
* **Taxes, Medicare, and SS:** $486.49 (10.2%)
* **Checking Account:** $1,192.40 (25%)

# Debt:

* **Student Loans:** $16,500 at an average 5% interest, with payments required by March 2026.

# Considerations:

I have student debt, and I'm contemplating whether to allocate my 2024 tax refund toward building my emergency fund or paying down my student loans. While I lean toward bolstering my emergency fund, the Dave Ramsey approach urges me to prioritize paying off the debt. I have the goal of a 6 month emergency fund and tax refund should get me to that goal. The reason I want to really pursue that is that I was terminated in 2022 and it took almost 3 months to find a new job and another month just to get the first paycheck. The termination really set us back and so I want to be future proof the next time around.

We own our car Chevy Cruze 2019 with 95,000 miles its paid off.

I’m also considering resuming my eBay reselling business, which has been my most profitable side hustle. My plan would be to use the income from reselling to pay off my student loans while keeping my job income for expenses and personal use.

Additionally, I know the Baby Steps and the FOO suggest holding off on 529 contributions, but I grew up without financial support for college, which motivates me to assist my children in some way. I feel a strong urge to provide for their future and without the sense that I am doing that I feel like I am failing my children, so I want to keep that in mind.

Lastly, I have term life insurance worth $450,000.

# Questions:

1. Given my current cash flow, how should I prioritize my emergency fund versus my student loans?
2. Is it wise to reinvest in eBay reselling to help pay down debt, considering the loan's relatively low interest rate?
3. Are there any adjustments you would recommend to my current budget allocations?

personalfinance,A parent emptied an account I didn't know we shared  - want to bounce back.,"Hey personalfinance,

So recently, I've hit a snag in my savings. And I'm not really seeking legal advice, but rather a way to bounce back. My parent with whom I've cut communication, emptied a savings account of mine that housed around 20k. It wasn't a lot, but it was money I was saving for a rainy day.

I've already sought advice on legal recourse (too expensive, for what I'm hoping to get back), criminal recourse (allegedly nothing criminal because they were allegedly a co-owner of the account), as well as considering breaking no-contact. Which I'm not going to.

What I **am** looking for is advice on how to break down my income in order to bounce back as quickly as possible. The obvious answer is squirrel away as much as I can, but I'd love numbers.

I make approximately 4k biweekly, and I'm planning on doing:

15% to debt repayments (to get that down as quickly as possible)

35% to variable MoM expenses

25% to discretionary short-term

10% to my RSP (matched by my employer)

*5% to short term savings*

5% to TFSA

5% to a notice savings fund

Is that too much for variable MoM expenses and discretionary short term? I'm willing to discuss numbers. I can also just hold off on the TFSA and the notice savings until the short term bounces back. But I also don't want to pump a short term savings account full of money and be tempted to spend it.

Thanks in advance.

I called MetLife make sure EOB is correct and they said yes, my dentist can’t charge me over $220, so they have to refund me the money I overpaid them.
So I called my dentist, they said they didn’t get the payment from MetLife yet,and if they receive an amount greater than what I have already paid then they will refund me(very confusing for me). The Negotiated fee isn’t correct (which I don’t understand 🤔)

He is an hour and a half away, due to that and my work schedule it makes it extremely difficult to meet at his or my bank during banking hours.

I’ve been wanting a new vehicle for 4 years (driving paid off 2015 Mazda 6) and specifically a Honda Ridgeline for 2 years. 

I own 3 duplex’s. I’ve recently hit a rough patch that has me doing my own work due to rent loss/vacancy because the money isn’t there right now to pay for labor. Things are turning around and I will be righting the ship soon, but it makes me think I could/should do more of my own work. Every time I need to send a handyman out it’s automatically minimum $250 out the door. BUT, that isn’t every week or even every month and doesn’t mean a truck would make me doing my own labor any easier in most instances (depending on what’s needed from the hardware store or what kind of bulk clean out I need to do)

I plan on buying more rentals (yes I want to retire early, yes I somewhat am interested in FIRE and have changed my lifestyle due to this)

I love my car and recently put new tires and struts on it and it’s been an amazingly reliable vehicle. I would be sick with regret if I get this Ridgeline and repair bills start adding up. But, I also want the new bells and whistles of heated seats/carplay/ABILITY TO TOW MY OWN BOAT and not rely on others for help (I.e. my boat isn’t getting used because of this)

I’m also outdoorsy so ease of throwing everything dirty/muddy in a truck bed compared to having to finesse/fit into a sedan trunk is another dream of mine. 

OR, do I just buy a beater and keep my reliable Mazda for my daily? I don’t have driveway space left so the beater would need to stay at another property, which COULD be a pain to coordinate to have tenants give me access, but I also don’t think I can use that as an excuse to trade in my Mazda and get the Ridgeline to have just one vehicle.

Many traditionalists say that owning a home is a great investment and seem to believe it makes you money in the long run, I however don’t see how this is possible. 

Costs to own a home include: down payment, upfront mortgage/loan costs, more expensive insurance, property taxes, paying the same amount or more in interest as you pay in principle in the long run(so the house really costs x2 what you’d think if you get a 30 year mortgage), having to pay for repairs which the suggested rate is 1% of the homes value each year, and also, not counting this in but, your time to keep up with regular maintenance like mowing the lawn. 

When it’s all said and done, if the market doesn’t do something crazy like what happened in 2020, you don’t make money, you just pay less than if you were to rent.

That being said, has anyone kept a detailed log of EVERY cost they’ve had to put into their house and what the true cost of ownership really is? And how this differs from renting on a pure financial stand point?

Monthly combined income after Taxes 9,200.

personalfinance,Not sure what to do with my ESPP,"So currently I contribute 7% of my paycheck to a Roth 401k with a 5% employer match. I recently just found out about an ESPP that my company also does. The plan allows for purchasing shares at a 10% discount. Something that seems sort of unique about the plan is that I can contribute up to 50% of my paycheck towards the plan or $22500, whichever is higher. The kicker is that you have to hold the shares for at least 1 year before selling. I probably wouldn’t do something as drastic as putting 50% of my paychecks into the plan, but I see on a lot of threads that people are recommending to max out what they allow since the discount is such a huge advantage. Wondering if anyone has any insight on what I should do, if it should be more conservative and use the plan how it’s designed and put 1-5% in and hold long term.. or if I should try a different strategy of putting something like 25-30% of my paycheck into the plan and selling each pay period after holding it for a year, the stock has performed well over the past decade or so.

personalfinance,Update on cancelling Whole Life policy.,"I posted this on Friday [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fqzjm0/should\_i\_cancel\_my\_whole\_life\_policy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fqzjm0/should_i_cancel_my_whole_life_policy/)

As expected, it was practically unanimous that I cancel the policy. So I messaged the company telling them that I wanted to do so. Here is what they came back with:

&gt;There are many options available that you may consider instead of surrendering your policy, such as:  
•Taking out a policy loan or withdrawal  
•Utilizing the automatic premium loan feature  
•Changing your dividend option  
•Lowering the face amount of the policy  
•Changing the policy to a Reduced Paid Up or Extended Term  
•Premium Mode Changes  
•Removing riders, etc.

Are any of these options worth considering? Or is this just a way for them to get me to stay.

To recap the initial post, I've been paying $300 a month for over 9 years, put over $33k in. The cash value is $27k. Death benefit is $282k.

It also said that if I still wanted to cancel, send them some information and they'll send me back a cancellation form in a couple business days. I've done so, but in the meantime, just wondering if any of these other options are valid.",1727720347.0,1,6,1ft2ja2
personalfinance,Don't know how to handle my money - Credit card debt getting out of hand ,"I'm in my mid 30's and have credit card debt. I expect to receive a six-figure windfall of 100-150k in the next 3 months. I only make about 15k-20k per year on my tax returns. I have about 25k in stocks and crypto. and 3k in a 401k.

My main credit card is maxed out at 9k and I have 2 smaller cards at a 60%+ utilization rate—about 15k total credit card debt. My minimum monthly payment on the 9k card is $300+. I can barely make the minimum payment. 

I don't know what to do between now and the next 3 months. I'm at the point where I will start falling behind and unable to make the payments which will tank my already low credit score of 626 even further. 

Much smarter people than myself have told me to get a zero-balance transfer card or a personal loan. I'm stuck researching these and don't know which way to go. Other people have told me to sell my stock positions to pay off the debt but I feel it's a bad time to sell during an election year.

Are they closing the account due to lack of repayments or because a fault of their own?

Shall I offer to carry on with the payments or would I just be throwing money down the drain?

personalfinance,Need advice. Totaled car and 13k in credit card debt.,"My car was determined to be totaled and I am set to receive a bit under 11k as a payout. My car was already paid off so I'll be receiving that total amount. My initial plan was to buy a car in the 10-15k range so that I had little to nothing to pay on a car note.

However, due to mostly stupidity and Covid unemployment, I reached up to 13k in credit card debt. After losing a salary position due to company downsizing, I didn't properly adjust to my new income, and the credit card debt grew a bit and then ballooned into what it is now during Covid unemployment.

The credit card has gone unused for the most part, but even now, I can only afford the minimum payment of $450-500 which after interest, barely puts a dent in the debt.

**So my question is: Rather than putting the money from my totaled car towards another car, should I put all of that money towards my credit card debt? Is there any cons to this that I am unaware of?**

I feel like this would put me in a position to where I'd be able to actually pay off my debt and would be much better off paying on a car note of $200-300 which will gradually pay off my car rather than the endless abyss my current credit debt is in.

**Also is it possible to claim what I estimate to be $5k+ in unclaimed unemployment during the Covid pandemic this many years later?** Once again, stupidity that I didn't receive all the unemployment that I could have, but the unemployment website was constantly crashing for months during that time.

personalfinance,4% rule vs 4%. Looking for opinions and options.,"First off, I understand the 4% rule, and that it alone is quite conservative.   I am trying to set my mother up for retirement as best I can with the limitation that she started saving for retirement after I did.  Trying to keep it simple since I do want to micromanage her accounts for her.

So was thinking that if I simply have her withdraw 4% every year may be an easy way to do that.  Would prevent her from trying to look up inflation and figuring it out from that.  I see the obvious downside is bad years would make her withdraw less then the previous, but overall, I would expect available spending to increase.  Rather or not 4% of what she has would be enough is beside the question.

I just want to get some opinions and advice.  Just bits of information incase it's needed.:

- She is currently 62, and has the Following accounts:

*  Roth setup with Dividend ETF's (SCHD, NOBL, VYM, VYMI) targeting about 4%: $39077
* Brokerage setup with Dividend ETF's (SCHD, NOBL, VYM, VYMI) targeting about 4%: $21280 
* Fundrise Income account: $42693 - Note, I am paying $500 into this since I bought her house from here.  Currently a Quarterly dividend of 565.99
* Rollover IRA that I primarily have here in VOO: $159162
* 401K Primarily in VOO: $60255
* A Brokerage account due to ESO.  Mckesson: $6008
* Estimated monthly Social Security: $1639 @ 62yo
* HSA setup to invest all but $3k into VOO:  $5308

She does have Medical issues which may prevent her from working during retirement, though she is currently still working, making contributions to here 401k. Because of said medical issues, I have here in a bit more risky setup then I would prefer, but worried about her having a fixed income that is too low.  Will move the $500/mo to a more conservative investment when I feel the income is enough.

This started out to compare a straight 4% vs the ""4% rule"", but if there are any suggestions on anything, I would like to hear it.

I missed seeing the reversal on my account so it went unnoticed till 9/19 when i got a letter from the HOA attorneys stating i have not paid the required fees for the storm damage. read more of the letter and I am on the hook for the attorney fess and interest on the fee, so the new total amount due is $629.54. 

I called Wells Fargo on 9/20 and they could not give me an explanation to why the check was reversed, i have an open complaint that they have 10 days to respond back and provide answers. the 10th day will be 10/4 so it is approaching and it is not looking promising for a good response.

I paid the attorneys the 629.54 in cash on 9/24 so I would not get anymore interest and attorney fees as they were ready to take it to court.   

I am wondering if I should be reaching out to anyone else regarding Wells Fargo's reversal of the check that put me on the hook for $175.

personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #10: Cut spending meaningfully! (October, 2024)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Cut spending meaningfully!** What does ""meaningfully"" mean? You get to decide that for yourself, but it should be a bit of a challenge. Set a goal that is neither too easy nor too difficult and track your progress. This month's challenge is about making intelligent spending choices so you can better allocate your money and reach your financial goals. Here are some tips to get you started:

* If you participated in September's challenge, you have a bit of a head start. Use what you learned to identify a budget category to attack and set a reasonable goal to reduce your spending in that area.

* If you did not participate in September's challenge, you can still participate! Use [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) or look at your banking statements to review your spending for last month to identify your budget category of choice.

* Set a measurable monetary goal for yourself. ""Spending less"" is not measurable. Adopt a specific numeric goal so that you can clearly identify whether you were successful.

* Keep your goal reasonable. Spending $0 on housing might save you a lot of money, but it is probably not a reasonable goal for most people.

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done each of the following things:

* Identified at least one budget category where you will reduce spending and set a specific goal for that reduction.

* Shared that budget category, last month's spending in that category, and your measurable reduction goal in the comments on this post.

* At the end of the month, share whether you met your goal in this thread or the weekend thread!

It has a 5% introductory/promotional rate.  The consideration hers is whether to keep the HELOC balance or pay it off.  What would be a better path to help alleviate taxes?  Is this a smart move or am I pissing away interest payments?  Also, any suggestions to help alleviate taxes?  Its an odd problem to have, but our cash flow is high and I don't feel like we are efficiently managing it and paying the price because of it.  ",1727786209.0,1,7,1ftn0io
personalfinance,I need help restructuring my debt! ,"I really need someone else's advice on my situation. I am perplexed about what to do with my high interest personal loan and credit cards. I make decent money but I don't know if I am missing out on a better plan than what I am doing. Here's the breakdown:

Personal loan: $4000 at 35% APR

Capital One CC: $1000 at 29%

Capital One CC: $2797 at 27%

Apple CC: $500 at 26%

Target CC: $1400 at 27%

Citibank CC: $2,400 at 27%

**Total balances: $12,097**

**Total Monthly Payments: $900** (approx. sometimes I pay more when I can)

  
My question is; what makes financial sense?

Currently, I am paying my credit cards using the ""snowball method"". Based on my calculations it may take me about 18 months to pay them off. My problem with that is the interest I will pay by the end is ridiculous.

Would a personal loan for 20-24% to consolidate all of the above make more sense? This may seem obvious to some but seriously want to make sure I know all my options. 

Although I make my payments on time and I'm utilizing 40% of my credit, my credit score is between **620-650.**

**I appreciate any feedback! :)**

M38 looking to buy my first home. Average prices in my area are around 300k. I have 240k in savings which includes an emergency fund. I consider my emergency fund 30k, so really I have 210k to put towards a home.

My question is, if I were to buy a home that costs 300k, would it make sense for me to put a large down payment (over 50%) on the home, or just put 10-20% down and invest that money?

I'm a single mother and have no idea where this start.

I am in middle  management usually. I have dumbed down my cv, even applying for just stocking shelves  at a local supermarkets. Nothing.

I did set up a small business just after I got made redundant but after the death of my father a few months afterwards, I slumped unto a deep greif and it all went by the wayside. I'm slowly in the process of getting it up and running again, but there's no sign of an income from this until at least the end of the month when I can start trading again (I do local fairs and events)

I have £80 to my name, and fortunately I live in the UK and my basics are covered (rent &amp; bills) but it's barely leaving us enough money for food. 

I am so desperate and embarrassed by this. I've always been hardworking and relevatively successful. But over the past 10 months all my efforts have come to naught. 

We have now reached critical point and I don't know where to turn. I need to start earning money this week. This is an impossible ask I know. 

My saving grace is that I am a writer. I can pick up freelance projects etc but AI has shut down all the content mills (terrible pay but at least it would have been *something* and you could pick up writing in a day, great for situations like this).

In other words, your account’s investment earnings should cover the 4% withdrawal, meaning you’ll consistently have $1 million providing income.

I'm doing very well for myself, but when I plug my number is into a retirement calculator, the amount of money I contribute doesn't have nearly as big of an impact as the rate of return. This is challenging for me, but at the same time, I'm really proud of myself for saving as much as I have so far. What frame of mind should I bring this situation? What would you do in my situation? 



Details: 

I'm in the middle of my career, strong net worth, decent salary, good budget. If I save 15% and earn an 8% return I'll be able to retire comfortable at 65 or very wealthy at 72. If I up my savings rate, even to 25%, it barely makes a difference at the calculations for how much I'll have at retirement. But simply increasing my expected rate of return to 10% makes a huge difference. This feels futile to me, like I've already done everything I can and there's not much point in putting in effort anymore...

I'm definitely going to continue saving, and I'm going to continue working on my career, I've got to make sure I stay relevant until retirement age.

investing,"What is my Trading Method Called?  ""Double-Limit Buy/Sell Bracket Order""?","When I was seven years old, my father explained gambling to me; and I understood if I bet one dollar then I would be returned two dollars if won, or zero if lost.  So I reasoned if I got back zero instead of two, then I would simply gamble again with two dollars to regain my original bet.  If I lost the two dollars, then bet four, then eight, etc., for I knew it was impossible to lose forever.  I thought I had discovered the secret to winning at gambling; then over ten years later I learned that this method is called the ""Small Martingale"", named after some French guy.

After I was working at a big company and was allowed to trade 401k funds, then I started thinking about gambling again.  When I would see the market fluctuate, I wondered how to buy when it went low and then sell when it back up.  That's when I invented my scheme to do that:  I put in a buy order if the price goes down (e.g. if the price drops 1%, then buy 1% more of what you have);  and I also put in a Sell order if the price goes up (1% rise, sell 1% of the position.)

So what is this scheme called?  There are always two limit orders -- a buy and a sell.  ""Bracket"" order is a name already taken, which stands for two 100% sell orders. I am not conceited like Monsieur Martingale to want my name on this method; how about -- Double-Limit Buy/Sell Bracket Order?

His reasoning was that he believes the market participants probably ""know"" something that he may not know.

investing,How do you do a proper research on a company?,"I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.

Now it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by [Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.

So I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.

investing,Call me crazy but ROI on AI is already good,"AI investments are proving their worth faster than many expected, especially for tech giants like Facebook (Meta). In 2022, hyperscalers saw their Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) dip as they ramped up AI spending. However, the latest data shows that their ROICs have already largely recovered outside of MSFT, even as they continue to grow their capital expenditures. If ROIC across the board continued to drop as capex has increased over the past 3 years these arguments about AI needing to move the needle may have some merit but that has not been the case.

[https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D](https://imgur.com/a/Npft53D)

This quick turnaround highlights how effective AI is in driving value, not just hype. Take Facebook as an example. By integrating AI into their ad services, Facebook dramatically improved ad targeting and personalization, directly boosting ad performance and revenue. The optimization of AI-driven ad placements allowed them to deliver better results for advertisers, which translated into higher prices per ad and improved ad load efficiency. This AI-driven approach is a clear demonstration of how AI investments can rapidly translate into tangible financial benefits, reinforcing the high ROIC we are seeing across the board.

personalfinance,Transitioning toward homebuying,"I'm a mid 30s professional living in a small, medium cost of living city in the Midwest. My partner and I are planning to move to a large, high cost of living city in the Northeast in the next 6-8 months. We currently rent, but are considering buying after the move. We are overwhelmed and I'd like some input and reassurance. The numbers below refer just to my income and assets. My partner is in a similar position. We currently split rent and household costs evenly, and plan to do so after the move as well.

1. I'd like to use the money currently invested with Vanguard toward a down payment. I think I should get it out of the brokerage account and into something like a HYSA, but when? How long before I hope to buy should I make that move? Should I try to time the market and sell a lot at once while prices seem high, or just take out a certain amount per week over a few weeks?
2. I will need to shift a lot more budget toward rent or mortgage when I move. Should I pull that money from retirement contributions or cut other savings? Are there any other big imbalances in my budget?
3. Is it reasonable for my partner and I to buy a \~$1,000,000 house? All those ""how much house can you afford"" calculators say yes, but they don't seem to scale well, somehow.
4. Are we gonna be okay? Sometimes I look at the numbers and think I'm in great shape and have lots of options; sometimes I think even with everything going for me I'll never be able to buy a house and rent will keep growing and I'll end up under a mountain of debt.

  
ETA: To answer some common questions, I don't expect my income to change (I work remote and am cleared to do so in any state), and my partner and I plan to split down payment evenly ($150k each). No kids, ever. The $1,000,000 number is our best estimate from searching Zillow for 2 bedroom homes in the area (we both work from home, so a dedicated office is crucial) - I think it's that or rent until the next housing crash, which maybe is a-ok!.

personalfinance,Budgeting Software For My Girlfriend,I'm looking for a good budgeting app or software for me and my girlfriend. Recently we started feeling a bit of struggle and I've only ever done rough budgets on paper every once and while. Beyond that we really haven't been tracking besides our individual bill contributions. I know this topic has been beat to death but I'm left with so many options its been overwhelming trying to decide what one for our needs. So hopefully being more specific might lead me to what I'm looking for. I tired YNAB but as we keep our finances mostly separate with transferring money between each other for shared bills and it felt YNAB only would work having everything combined. Maybe I just didn't spend enough time learning it but i felt it felt limiting with what i wanted to use it for. So I'm looking for something that allows me to make separate budgets for each other with our own bills in addition to a combined budget. For example we each pay a portion of rent and i noticed most budgeting sites only allow us to write a single rent line where we'd more benefit for two lines for our separate contributions. We also separate our larger bills between checks to try and maintain a consistent amount of spending/saving money so id like a budget that while is monthly also allows us to work on a biweekly basis. Additionally if it could link to our bank accounts that would be preferred as well. I realize i might not get everything or exactly what I'm looking for but if i could be lead to the closest options that would be great. Thanks in advance.,1728247379.0,0,1,1fxqdgb

Lets say you are under the age of 50. Cant you just rollover your traditional 401k contributions every year into an external Roth IRA (lets say Fidelity) and then take it out and repeat this every year? I know Roth IRA has a limit of around $6,500 per year and that you are allowed to take out your contributions from the Roth IRA (just not earnings) without a penalty.

Still, wouldn't this just make it so there's no point in an early withdrawal penalty from the traditional 401k? Is that penalty put in place to just not allow huge amounts of withdrawals?",1728247366.0,0,3,1fxqd9d

personalfinance,Taxable Brokerage or Roth IRA/401k for 5 year early retirement bridge account?,"52 yo now and just realized that retiring at 55 looks like a legit option.  I have 64% in trad 401k, 11% in Roth 401k, 16% in Roth IRA, 6% in HSA, 3% in brokerage.  Total of about 750k as of now.  I'll be getting a moderate pension of about 35k starting at 55.  I'll have access to my traditional 401k due to the rule of 55 but prefer to keep my income low for ACA subsidies.

My goal in the next 3 years is to build a bridge from 55 to 59.5.  My two best choices seem to be either putting money into my taxable brokerage account or upping my Roth 401k contributions.  Brokerage money would be easier to get to but the gains may get taxed.  The idea with the Roth 401k is to roll that over to my Roth IRA after retirement and use the ""contributions"" portion to keep my income low.  Obviously I couldn't take out the earnings portion before 59.5 but I should have significant contributions to pull from.  

Any suggestions or advice?  Feels like I might be missing something but not sure what.  Maybe I should just build up my savings account during the next few years.",1728245072.0,1,5,1fxphb1

personalfinance,Advice please.  Is my current retirement saving plan enough? Roth IRA Max + 401K match? Or do I need to do more?,"I've been trying to figure out this ""saving retirement"" thing by myself for awhile.   I'll be turning 32 in a couple months and unfortunately, my one parent I have has saved nothing for retirement, and is in fact in debt and doesn't know how to help me.  I've been contributing 6-7% of my income to my work's 401k since fall of 2018.  Match is roughly 50% up to 6%.  Of course my income has risen greatly since then.  I currently have about $17k in the 401k.  Just got a promotion and will be soon making about $45k gross a year.  After which I expect a 3% increase in my pay each year (company standard).   I plan to keep my contribution at 6%, and the funds are automatically invested.   I also contribute about $30 a month to an HSA (not invested).

I have finally saved up enough for my emergency fund (which is in a HYSA) that I can start putting money into a Roth IRA (Didn't really understand what IRAs were until a year ago anyway).  It only has $300 in it right now, but I plan to max it out ($7k) by Jan 1st for the 2024 year, and then plan to keep maxing out going forward.

I also should mention, I have a CD account that I contribute what I can every month that makes 5.3% APY.  I'll probably be able to contribute $250 to it a month going forward after maxing out my Roth IRA. I want to use this fund to build up incase I need to buy a house in the future.  I'm still trying to figure out how the Roth IRA works honestly, and what funds I should invest in... I'm only about middle to low level risk tolerant, I suppose.

Anyway, is this enough if I want to retire at 65-67?   I don't really think I can afford to invest any more.  I would have to get a different higher paying job, but I love the job I have.  I don't want to leave it, but I need to know if I must...

More information about my financial situation that might be helpful:  I'm single, no kids (I have no plans to ever get in a relationship).  I live with my family which includes my elderly uncle (who owns the house), my mother, and my mentally disabled elder brother.  I pay rent on the house, but I should inherit it in the future (it'll be paid off in 15 years or less).  I'm still saving to pay for my own house tho just in case, cause you never know what can happen.   When my mother passes away, I'll be completely responsible for taking care of my dependent brother who receives a small SSI disability check a month and is on medicaid.  So that is also something to consider for my future expenses.

I have no car payments, I technically have student loans, but I'm not required to make payments on them atm, and is likely I will receive loan forgiveness on them (hopefully anyway).   Other than that, no debt.

I just want to make sure I'm doing things right and will be prepared.  Any advice you can give on investing, whether in a roth ira, 401 k, hsa, or wherever will be greatly appreciated.  I'm honestly still trying to understand how all of this works myself.",1728244397.0,1,20,1fxp7vc
personalfinance,Should I apply a large payment towards a car loan or towards a student loan ?,"I have a car loan of about $25,000 at 8% APR and student loans totaling $50,000 at 7% APR. I can put around $5,000 toward one of these loans.

Which loan do you think would be easier to refinance at a lower rate? I'm hesitant to use the $5,000 on one loan when I might be able to refinance the aforementioned loan at a much lower rate in the next couple of years, potentially diminishing the impact of that payment.

The transfer took quite a long time to process (over 6 months), and during this time my work switched their retirement plans to Fidelity. Shortly after that, I received a check in the mail made out to Vanguard with the balance of my tax-sheltered annuity, which was originally meant to be transferred to Vanguard directly. The check was seemingly written/printed several months beforehand, and was labeled as a replacement check, though I never saw an original check.

So I now have a check for Vanguard, with whom I no longer have any accounts, current accounts with Fidelity, and on my Principal account page, it shows the annuity having been distributed. The date of the distribution is shown to be about 11 months ago (when I originally started the process of the transfer). So the check is expired. 

I've been trying to connect with anyone with Principal and Fidelity to try to figure this out, but have not gotten any clear answers. Wondering if anyone here has advice on what I should do to get the money on this expired check to Vanguard into my Fidelity account?",1728240287.0,1,1,1fxnm4r
personalfinance,Tips or Advice on credit cards?,"So long story short, I am trying to come calculate the exact formula in an excel spreadsheet of how interest is calculated each month.

personalfinance,Renting vs Buying: Investment or Debt Trap?,"tl;dr: renting is best for primary residence, while owning is lucrative for real estate investors.

I've recently thought about renting vs buying properties in real estate, and I wanted to share my conclusions. A few arguments I hear most often when discussing this topic are: 

1. Owning a home builds **equity** - while renting doesn't build any assets, it's **throwing money away**. 
2. When I bought my home it cost me **$100k** and now it's worth **$200k** - therefore I made 100k profit.
3. Homes appreciate in value, therefore home ownership is an **investment** 

On the surface these arguments seem compelling, if owning a home means owning an asset - while renting is just making the landlord money, then it must make sense to own a home, right?

Turns out the situation is more complex that what it seems, and I argue home ownership for the sake of living in the property leads many Americans to a **debt trap**, let me explain why I believe this:

1. It is hard to keep track of your **cost basis** when it comes to home ownership, especially when using it as both a place to live and an investment property. The list price of the home when you bought and sold is a gross simplification, at the very minimum the basis should include the transaction costs, the interest on the mortgage, and the property taxes paid for the duration of the investment. 
2. Buying a home comes with additional **phantom costs** that are hard to estimate: your utility bills may go up to heat the home, you may spend money trying to make the home ""yours"", lifestyle inflation often accompanies home purchases: new couch? never mind, new car! The HVAC system may need to be replaced, contractors, gardeners etc.
3. Middle class owners don't pay their **mortgage** - they focus on the monthly payment, refinance, take HELOCs to ""invest in the property"", and then often move to a new property and get a new mortgage. All these common actions reset the clock, and make you pay interest to the banks. For example during a 30 year mortgage, the amortization schedule shows the first 5 years of payments go almost exclusively towards interest.

For real estate investors the story is very different:

1. They operate via LLCs to separate taxes, expenses and mortgages from their personal self
2. They buy duplexes and triplexes in areas where it is easy to find tenants, they don't live in the properties
3. They try to minimize the cost of contractors and avoid ""luxury"" renovations - cheaper the better
4. They claim tax deductions and business expenses to increase profit margins, they defer capital gains taxes via 1031 exchange forms, they leverage their position via mortgages to amplify returns

  
In conclusion I believe housing costs are somewhat life food costs: **dead money** that is spent as a necessity for a roof over your head and food on the table. Investments are not for necessity - they aim at growth via capital appreciation and dividends, they come with risk. They are quite different and real estate arguments often merge the two.

personalfinance,Buying a house to my father live in,"My father has always been a hard worker, but managing money has never been his strong suit. He struggles with saving, especially for something as significant as a down payment, and I feel like a lot of his income is being wasted. As he gets older, I’m increasingly worried about his financial future, particularly with no investments or savings for retirement.

I’ve been thinking that, since I’ve managed to save some money, I could buy a house for him to live in. He would pay rent to me, just like he does now, but the difference is that by the time he retires, I could sell the house and return the rent payments he made over the years.

personalfinance,Now or after elections for a HELOC?,"Curious on thoughts and opinions about taking a fixed rate HELOC out now or waiting until after elections? I’ve gotten different advice from people.

We originally were interested in selling our home and purchasing a new one, but yeahhhhh this market is atrocious. In our area we have mostly very outdated, 1900sq homes wanting 500k. Not even sure how they’d get appraised for that much, but I digress. New builds are around 700k for 2400sq so we feel pretty hopeless in that department right now. 

So we decided to stay for a little while longer until we can get what we want. We have probably around $130,000 or more in equity, but have only been in the home for 4 years so. We are considering taking out a 60k HELOC, paying off all credit card debt (no worries on re-using the cards, they’re chopped up except for like 2). And then using the rest for a few house updates to make living there more comfortable. 

I’m just torn between exploring this now or waiting until post November. I know we would choose a fixed interest (which is an option through our credit union), but I’ve gotten conflicting thoughts from others.

personalfinance,Should we sell or stay? Advice needed!,"Editing to add: we do need more space. We have a 4 bedroom house with no office, 2 kids and both WFH.

Hi All- appreciate you taking the time to read this as I don't have a lot of financially literate family or friends to lean on. So here's the story:

My husband and I own our home and we have close to $400k in equity. We are however staring down at least $75k in repairs coming in the next 5-10 years (roof, windows, driveway). Our mortgage is an extremely comfortable $2500/mo compared to our $250k/yr combined household income.

We are torn between staying and paying for the fixes as they come, probably $25k a year for a few years (which we are able to save easily enough with our debt to income ratio). Or moving to a newly built home, which in our area will cost 1 million - 1.5 million, this would raise our mortgage to $6500.

Our monthly net is $16,050 and monthly debt with utilities/groceries/nanny/car payment/mortgage is $7500. This doesn't include fun money or savings.

We already have $150k in a HYSA, makes us about $5k a year right now and growing. With either house I still plan to put around $12k a yr in there for our kids college and emergencies. We have $280k in 401k and an investment property worth $1 million my husband will inherit before retirement (he is beneficiary of a trust). So we have a decent nest egg we won't touch in either situation.

So what would be the best decision for us financially? Is a small mortgage the safer bet? Or will it be simpler to have a new house with minimal to no repairs? When I think about both options, neither really comes out on top as the financially better decision, so that's why I'm making this post. I'm hoping the fine folks of Reddit will see something I don't see or know something I don't know, so appreciate any advice!",1728235736.0,0,32,1fxlunj
personalfinance,"Recently received windfall, how do I invest it?","This is my first post on Reddit, and I'm not 100% sure this is the best place to inquire about this, but I'm currently open to suggestions.

Some details about the situation, my mother recently passed and had a life insurance policy as well as 2 401Ks and a Traditional IRA. I believe there are some other accounts tied to investments as well, but we're currently working on figuring out the specifics. The life insurance policy was about $50k and that has been cleared recently with my financial institution. Unfortunately, said financial institution could not (or would not) answer my questions regarding any of investments outside of CDs,  nor could they answer any questions about inherited IRAs and the other retirement accounts. 

I had done some research on the topic and it was to my understanding that I would have to pull about 10% of the retirement accounts yearly if they stayed under her name or I could just reinvest them under my name. I recently reached out to a financial advisor that was recommended to me by a good friend, but I have yet to hear back from them. I'm also worried that perhaps a financial advisor isn't the best idea as I've been warned that they may a conflict of interest regarding how my money is invested. 

For background, I work at Home Depot who offers discounted Home Depot stock (which I'm told is doing really good right now) and am currently earning about $20/hr before tax+ insurance. I don't have much outside $1000/mo rent with a roommate as far as bills are concerned. My car is paid off, and I'm working on clearing out my credit cards. I've never seriously invested before, just $100 here and there on crypto or stocks I saw doing well. 

Honestly, I feel really over my head right now as I've never had this sort of liquid money before. That and I'm being pressured by YouTube's algorithms to get on the investment train as soon as I can. 

Apologies if this is poorly formatted, and I appreciate any advice y'all could offer me.

-normal savings account and certificates of deposit 
-roth ira and making my child the beneficiary 
-money market account
-529b account 

from my understanding this is the explanation of all of these options and questions i have about each
Savings account and CDs 
-doesn’t come with a card or checkbook
-usually has lower interest rates than money market account so it’s slower to build but with purchase of CDs can get a better interest rate than the account itself
-easy to deposit into
-can be done at the bank i already use
-would a high yield saving account be better than a normal saving account? if so how is a high yield savings different? 

roth ira
-limits on how much can be deposited per year
-can reduce retirement savings
-can’t access until a certain age
-can multiple children be listed as beneficiaries and would they get around the same amount? even if they need access to the money at different times? 

money market account
-sometimes comes with card or checkbook to make paying bills out of it easier which would make paying for tuition easier 
-usually has higher APY than normal savings account 
-interest rates can depend on the federal reserve 
-online banks get the best APY
-literally how is this different from a savings account? is it essentially just a high yield savings account? 

529b account
-can only be used for education and can face fees if used for something else
-easy way to build for college
-how it’s ran is different from state to state
-would i still face the fees if we used the money in a down payment in a house? 
-exactly how bad are the fees if it’s not used on education?

Would it be better to apply for the loan myself, have her apply for it herself, myself apply with her as a co-signer, or her apply with myself as a co-signer? It’s fairly small loan we’re looking for ($16,500) but I would like to get the best rate available to us. Also, I am planning on going through Sunlight as it is a private party purchase.

personalfinance,UK based and looking for advice to build a future!  ,"Hi guys, new to this subreddit 

I'm a 21m living in London and my girlfriend 25m has just moved in with me. 

I make around £8k per month after taxes and work pay for both my rent &amp; car. My girlfriend makes £32k with no perks and doesn't pay towards anything for us as a couple. 

I have around £110k saved in a Chip account but no investments or pension. Zero debt apart from a rolling balance of 2-5k on my Amex, paid monthly.

We live a fairly comfortable life eating out regularly, shopping &amp; travelling frequently but the last few months I feel I could be doing more to prepare for the future &amp; buy a house. 

I want to invest but I'm not comfortable with risking large sums. I've told my girlfriend we need to tighten the spending a little and I'm aiming to save £6k per month. Any advice on what I should be doing with the money (not wanting to purchase property yet) and what I should do with my existing savings? 

Thanks in advance! ",1728256633.0,1,1,1fxtq1h

personalfinance,Condo association's electric bill got sent to collections under my name months after I moved out,"I used to live in a 6-unit condo building. We were self-managed, so I was the treasurer who paid the bills through the condo association's checking account so all of the building's common area utilities were under my name for mailing purposes. For the sake of super duper clarification: the bills were not for my personal condo unit, they were for the common areas of the building and I was just the one who wrote the checks. 

I moved out in December 2023 and transferred treasurer duties to one of the other unit owners. Everything went swimmingly with all of the utilities except the electric company who were undergoing a rebranding. The new treasurer tried several times to have the building's account transferred from my name into his name, but the rebranding involved creating new account numbers for every account holder, what they ended up doing was creating a new account for the building under his name but also a new account for the building under my name. As bills kept showing up addressed to me, I was able to give them to him until the end of March when I finally sold my unit. Each time this happened, he called them and they assured him everything was sorted out.

Fast forward to last week when I received an email from a collection agency showing that I have $150 debt to the electric company, from March-May. I knew it had to be the building's account, because my personal unit's electric account was under my husband's name. I replied to contest the debt under the reasoning that it is not my personal debt because it's the condo association's account. But they replied and said it is technically my responsibility because my name is on the bill.

I've talked to the new treasurer of the association, and he understands the situation and he doesn't have a problem with paying the bill with the association's funds, but I am hesitant to have the bill paid while the collection agency is under the assumption that it is my personal debt. 

I don't know where to go from here in terms of making sure the bill gets paid but most importantly that it doesn't show up on my personal credit report that I had a bill go to collections (I've never paid anything late before). Does it matter that I did not authorize the creation of a new account under my name, which happened after I moved out? The account number on the bill is different than the account number to which I had been paying the association's bill for years. 

TL;DR: Electric bill for common areas of condo building used to be under my name. Electric company screwed up transition to new association treasurer by creating new accounts for both him and I. Ones addressed to me eventually became undeliverable after I sold my condo. Just got email from collections agency saying I'm responsible for a bill I didn't know existed. How do I make sure this stays off my personal credit report?",1728255087.0,5,3,1fxt73y
personalfinance,Does this situation qualify to file a credit card dispute for poor quality of services?,"I paid an audio shop to install a radio and speakers in my vehicle. Sound quality was pretty terrible after the installation. I contacted the shop, they made some adjustments in the settings, and there was still very little improvement. Their solution was to charge me another $1k to install an amplifier and subwoofer. Mind you, I had asked if an amplifier should be installed initially and they said it would be overkill. The subwoofer they recommended was large and would have taken up a good amount of our trunk space, which we did not want. We had already paid the shop $2300 at this point to install the radio, speakers, a remote starter, and to tint the windows.
I then went to another shop for a second opinion. They said the speakers we were provided with never should have been installed without an amplifier, and that they could install one without a subwoofer for $450. They offered to install a small subwoofer that would be hidden in our spare tire area for $500, which we have not done yet. They also told us that we should have been able to get a radio, speakers, amplifier, and subwoofer installed for the price we paid the first shop for just the radio and speakers. 
Sound quality has improved somewhat after installing the amplifier, but still is not acceptable. Phone call quality over bluetooth is also extremely poor, even after replacing the head unit under warranty. 
I contacted the first shop with this information and asked if they would be willing to work with us at all. Their only offer was to charge us more money and install a subwoofer in the trunk, which we again stated we did not want. I asked if they would be willing to refund $1k to compensate us for the additional money we would need to spend to get acceptable sound quality out of this system, and they declined.
Is this a situation in which I would have rights to file a credit card dispute for not being satisfied with the quality of services provided by the shop? If I do file the dispute and win, what are the chances the shop would try to take me to court?",1728255043.0,1,1,1fxt6kw

personalfinance,What finical mistakes should I avoid in my 20’s? ,"Hello r/personalfinance! 

This spring, I graduated from college and was able to find a job doing what I enjoy, while making $85,000 a year. 

I’ve always been very frugal, and optimized my expenses to around $1,000 a month while throughout college. $500 for rent and $500 for food, gas, phone, etc. 


Since my income has 5x’d, I’ve tried to keep my lifestyle the same, but my expenses have shifted towards around $1,500 a month. I’m able to feed myself properly (three meals a day) and allow myself more budget for hobbies, entertainment, and 401k contributions. The rest of my salary I put into savings. ~$3,500 a month after taxes goes to savings. 

I’ve been trying to follow the suggestions from this subreddit to max out my 401k contributions and save up 6 months worth of salary. So far, I have $14,000 in my savings. 

My parents want me to finance a reliable car so I can start building credit as I just barley got a credit card (670 credit score) However, the idea of having a car payment stresses me out and I’d rather own something completely. My current vehicles transmission just went out for the second time, so I do need something soon. 

I have ~$28,000 in student loans that I need to start paying soon, but have no other debt such as credit cards, etc. I have also thought about opening an IRA/ROTH IRA but am not sure if I should invest that money in getting my Masters instead. 

I know I am in a very lucky position, and have numerous forks in the road for my financial future. I wanted to get some of your opinions as to:

What I should prioritize? 
How I can maximize my opportunity? 
How I can avoid making bad financial decisions?

personalfinance,Liquidate Roth IRA and 401k to buy real estate short term rental?,"I'm 27 years old, and I'm itching to get more into real estate.  

I have about $80k equity in my primary residence, $40k in cash, $20k in my Roth IRA, and $40k in my 401k (company match has really made this sky rocket!)

I'm looking for about $100k cash to put towards a $500k short term rental investment property. 

Realistically I can probably save up the $100k in cash by the time I'm 30. 

I'm single in a MCOL city and make just over 6 figures and save a fair amount. 

I'm just wondering if it's a fair trade to pull some cash out of my retirement accounts to put towards a STR. 

Real estate is what I'm most passionate about.  I've found STRs that could easily cash flow $10-12k/year.   

That'd be a nice pay boost for bringing in cash, and would be able to save/invest most all of it, eventually putting it towards another down payment for a multifamily property in my hometown. 

My long term vision is mostly real estate, I love real estate.

personalfinance,"Need Help on Divorce Home Buyout of ""free and clear"" jointly owned home - STBX can't buyout but I could - what to do?","I am in the very start of a divorce with a whole lot of complications, but the one I want to focus on right now is that we own our home outright - no mortgage.

Probably worth about $400,000, it's big and nice and in a really good neighborhood.

Situation is: STBX will want to remain in the home as they are a SAHM and will be pushing for majority custody, not 50/50, and has not worked or maintained a career outside of a few part time jobs over the years. I will be paying child support and alimony to them

However, there isn't a lot of other assets or leverage for them to offset having the house become theirs and the hypothetical 50%, $200,000 equity I have in the home would leave me without that compensation as we divide assets. Them getting a refi of the property or mortgage for that $200,000 is probably very unlikely since they don't have a job and even if they got something soon, it's not going to be enough to get any sort of loan. Presently, if I financed $200k that payment is still cheaper than renting a run down apartment.

I was the single-income earner and have a decent income and likely can qualify for some sort of lending. I want the house if I can buy their share, however they simply may refuse to accept that as part of the settlement. I believe they would try and do whatever they could to remain with the home and primary custody, which would mean some sort of balancing of the asset split elsewhere.

The only place though we have to offset me taking a non-cash settlement for my half of the home's value would be their portion of my 401k (which isn't nearly enough), and then possibly the amount of alimony.

There is also the idea that the court would require the home to be sold instead of a buyout, but at that point I would prefer to find an option for them to remain there with my kids, as I would view it as the kids staying in the home we provided for them. But, that still leaves me without any sort of true-up for my portion of the home's value.

Basically we're in a circular logic trap because since the home is paid for, it's both too expensive for them to buy, but too valuable for them to relinquish without letting a judge decide. And if it got to the point of selling it on the open market, I would back down and look for other options since if I can't buy it, I'd prefer my kids still live there.

I can't find a lot of information on this scenario since most people divorce with a mortgage and the equity they have to settle and if someone can't afford the mortgage, they have no choice. But here, there is no mortgage obligation, which means that all that has to be reconciled is the offset of equity between us which can be done elsewhere.

What am I not thinking of in this scenario with regards to different approaches for me to buyout, or different approaches for them to balance the equity if they can't buy me out elsewhere? The only place I see them being able to compensate me is by reducing alimony and having that be their ""payment"" to me, but then without the alimony they are without income and just have a house and then child support and either reduced alimony, or whatever they can find with an entry level job.

I just need ideas I am not thinking of since the free-and-clear nature of the house is a variable I can't find any other posts about to compare to.",,1,0,1fxu351

I’m expecting the car I’m getting to cost at most 35k after any taxes and fees. I would be putting 20k down, so I’ll need a loan of 15k (max)

The hospital bills (all dated on the same day as the child's birth), used this new deductible amount rather than the $1750 deductible, which I had already met.

personalfinance,First Car Purchase Advice – Cash vs. Financing a 2024 Toyota Corolla LE,"Hey everyone! I’m a 26-year-old female looking to buy my first car with my boyfriend. We both graduated from grad school about a year ago and are based in the Bay Area, California. We plan to split the cost of the car 50-50, and our budget is between $22k and $29k OTD. Together we earn about $300k gross (around $150k each).

I recently switched jobs and now earn significantly more, but previously I was making around $85k. Over the past four months, I’ve saved up $7k for the car, while my partner has more set aside. We can afford to pay for the car in cash.

However, I’m unsure whether we should pay in cash or finance it. My partner is ready to cover the other portion (\~$21k) and assured me they won't be left illiquid. If we go the cash route, I plan to pay my partner back over the next year (about $550/month), and I even offered to pay interest (5%), but they declined.

Would there be any advantage to financing the car instead, where we put $14k down (splitting it 50-50) and finance the remaining $14k, paying it off aggressively within a year? Could this help us negotiate a better deal at the dealership?

I'm also concerned about the opportunity cost of investing the $14k. Would we potentially earn more in the market?

A bit more context: We might not be in the country after two years due to visa issues, so we plan to buy a new 2024 Toyota Corolla LE, which should hold its value. If we sell it in two years for around $20,000, that would still fit within our budget. If we end up staying for another 5-6 years, we’ll have a reliable car for the long haul.

One last note: as immigrants, we don’t have much credit history, but our credit scores are good. I’m worried I might not get the best interest rate on a loan, probably around 9-10%.

My only problem is that my take-home pay isn’t looking great :/ 

I make around $37k yearly whilst working full-time, but after taxes and insurance fees, my (biweekly) paychecks average around $850. Two years ago I was making $16/hr at a pizza place and somehow that was more affordable as the cost of living is absolutely kicking my ass. I USED to be able to put nearly half of my paycheck in my savings but that’s not really feasible right now. 

I don’t have a car or car insurance, but that’s about to change within this month. That definitely cuts down on some of my monthly fees (I occasionally have to use uber for transportation.) Through work I have our buy-up health plan — a slightly more expensive employees contribution for a cheaper deductible ($3,000 opposed to $6,000) — as well as dental, vision, and a HSA account which is fairly affordable. I’d love to keep all of these as I sort of /need/ coverage, but the ~$300 being taken out of my paycheck is really hurting rn. 

Phone bill & credit payments both add up to $60 each, weekly groceries tends to be $100, and I also have a mother who loves to shove random bills onto me 🕺 I’m doing okay right now, but after doing some math on what my monthly expenses will be after moving, I’m super worried about how much money I’ll have left over for any sort of surprise costs/emergencies/medical bills :( 

Money gives me a LOT of anxiety and I’ll take any advice anyone can offer. Should I give up on insurance ?? Should I go private?? Is there some secret for not living paycheck to paycheck that I’m not in on yet ??

EDIT: I originally made this really hastily on my break so I’m throwing in my cohesive costs per paycheck 🫡
- deductions; $304 
- groceries (what I buy but is realistically shared with my mom and brother); $150
- transportation; $25-$35

There seems to be more and more doom and gloom lately about hyperinflation, and while I think the US is too big to fail, there's always that small chance that it happens. That being said - I'm realizing that I have no hard assets and am feeling a bit exposed. Problem is, I'm in a state of limbo with regards to my personal life.

personalfinance,Looking for advice to get out of debt extreme HCOL,"I just want to start by I know how ridiculous this sounds and how privileged I am, we make great money I feel but we can’t make it work.

I make around $130k net
Husband makes $126k net
I get 42k a year from a trust. 

Our mortgage is 4K flat including insurance and property tax. I have 10.6million in a discretionary trust with trustees and our house is worth 1.1mil and we owe 430k on it. 

Our main issue is childcare, we live on an island with 3 daycares and we have been on the waitlist for all since we moved here and are not even close to getting in. We have a nanny which after everything is just over 5k which is actually the lower end of HCOL area for what Nannys get. I’m also pregnant. We just moved into our house last year and got lots of work done to make it livable and my husband was unemployed for 9 months waiting for his green card as we moved from aboard, though I am American. With this time lapse we ended up with 33k of credit card debt moving in, renovating, furnishing etc and the house isn’t even fully furnished. 

Where’s the rest of the money go? We spend 2k on groceries and this includes trader joes and costco where we bulk buy meat and I grow most of my own veggies. One bag of groceries here is $175 minimum. Ive seen one piece of veg be $11 at our store. The food prices are just insane. I used to spend $400 on groceries. That’s 2 days worth of meals now it feels. To be fair I’m buying real food and cook my own meals, which I think is actualllt WAY more expensive then processed food and takeout. Making my own dinner is easily $50/$75 bucks and going out is $30 for a plate.  My dog costs 1k a month and we usually end up spending 1k on medical bills. Not to mention everything else, phone bill, utilities, insurances, gasoline. 

I thought we would be able to pay off this debt quickly but it’s not budging, it’s our first home and we are quickly learning every month is a new expense. The oven broke, the septic pipe broke, the deck is rotting etc. every month.

My trust is discretionary and my trustee is not going to increase my monthly distribution and not going to help with the debt.

I love our home and island but thinking I need to sell the house and move to a lower cost state? I have no idea how other families are living here. Just for reference, neither of us drink at all, we have no gym memberships, no hobbies with costs, I don’t get my hair or nails done, we have a breville and make all our coffee at home. We have no car payment, we aren’t going on ANY weekends away. We do both contribute 10% to our 401ks. 

I just feel like all the posts I see where high earners can’t afford life everyone says I bet they spend all this money on stupid stuff but it’s been six months of truly buying nothing but food. No clothes, nothing. I truly could afford more in college. 

I just feel like the childcare and food costs here and insurmountable. 

I feel like if I just moved to Michigan i could live in a nice house and actually afford vacations and self care and pay off all our debt in one but I really really really don’t want to. It’s beautiful here. Guess I’m looking for someone to say you can’t afford to live there and need to suck it up and move. ",,1,12,1fxubyo
personalfinance,"New Job, New role, New goals.","Ok, I want to give a little backstory before I get to ask my question to give a better understanding of my goals and outcome. 

On average, I've worked between blue-collar jobs, or design/art/creative jobs, taking home an average of 50k a year for the last ten years. I mismanaged money a lot and took a lot of potential risks professionally and financially, however, I consider myself ""doing ok"" financially. (Please correct me if I'm wrong, that's sort of my goal here). I have less than 20k in debt to my name, and about 75% of that is just my newish car. The rest are just credit cards with low monthly balances. 

This last year I started to push to work on my debts and credit cards and managed to pay off a loan and pay my credit cards down to an ideal (for me) amount of -30%. But at the beginning of the summer, I lost my job and added some back to those as well as borrowed from an IRA to cover costs. My Partner makes a little more than I did so she covered rent while I tried to figure out bills and groceries. But I never lost the motivation to stay ahead of my debts. I had multiple savings accounts that I ate through BEFORE I borrowed from my IRA so I only took a minimal amount, but I didn't have much in there to begin with.

Now, I just got a job in sales, where I should, at minimum, make slightly more than 50k just on salary, but based on performance, bonuses, etc, I should average out to 80k. I know what my bills and expenses look like at 50k and I know what I can cover, but my goal is to take this next step and make better financial decisions to actively recover what I borrowed and build even faster so I can feel like I'm ""caught up"" to where I'm supposed to be to retire comfortably.

Here is a rough breakdown of my finances before I was terminated.  
(I'm rounding down just to make it even.)  
This also doesn't include my partner's finances so if the math doesn't math, it might be the exclusion:

•My monthly salary is around 4k with 3k covering all bills  
•Rent is $1300 where I live  
•I budget $50 a week going to the IRAs  
•I have two IRAs with about 20k combined managed by my financial advisor  
•I have a savings account with a 5.2% interest rate that I would loosely toss money into but as of right now there is about $250  
•I have another Savings account with 4.3% interest that HAD 1k, but as of right now it has like...$16.00  
•I have a savings account with my main bank with terrible interest that I don't even bother looking at that I would regularly put $40 a paycheck into. That is also depleted.   
•I pay my credit cards with about 25% more than the minimum payment across the board. I was on track to pay them off by the end of the year, but with losing my job it looks more like it'll be the end of the first quarter next year.  
•Once all bills are paid, Groceries are picked up, and the car is filled, I put whatever extra I have into whatever credit card has the highest limit.

Previously I felt things were manageable but tight, so I paid the most I could pay while still having some money in my pocket, but as I've hit my mid 30's I want to feel secure in my finances and still be able to build towards goals like owning a home and not crying myself to sleep so often. 

With my new job, I will be looking at 5-6k a month, but it breaks down to two checks, the first check is my base salary check, and the second is my commission check. We are also in the slow season so I'm basing this off of that, so the potential to make more is there, but I want to plan accordingly for it. My new role will also have a 401k with a 3% match.

**What would be the best steps moving forward on this, or should I just continue with my regimen going forward with just a small increase across the board?** 

I will add that the savings with 4.3 interest are more of a ""passive account"" where I contribute with online sales of items that I don't heavily push and from Jan 2024 to July 2024 I was able to make that 1k, but I feel like I should have put that in the higher interest account. The higher-interest account has more steps to contribute to and it is attached to stocks so I get less involved in it since I just want to keep buying random shares of things. 

My Partner makes slightly more than what I averaged a year but her take home is less because she contributes more to insurance, HSA, and her 401K.

What are my best steps?

personalfinance,Questions about a home equity loan,"Edited to add details:

My family has found ourselves in quite a bit of debt (taxes - 37,000, credit cards - 25,000) and are looking into taking out a home equity loan to help pay things off. Haven’t talked to anyone yet to know exactly how much equity we have but I would estimate 200,000 - 250,000. 

I spoke with my tax accountant about this and he recommended that if we go this route to take the maximum amount that is offered to us with the loan because he said we would only pay interest on the amount we use, we could have access to the rest of the money for emergencies if we needed it after paying off our debts, and if we were to ever consider taking out a second home equity loan in the future it would be harder because we already took out a first (I didn’t really understand why). 

My questions are:  
- Is he right that I should take out the max?  
- I know the feds cut rates recently. Has that affected home equity loan rates at all yet, if it will at all?  
- Should I use the same bank as where my mortgage is through?  
- Why is a future home equity loan harder to get?

personalfinance,$22k medical debt after healthy insurance for hospital stay due to pedestrian hit and run,"3 months ago I (25) was hit by a reckless driver while waiting to cross the street, she fled the scene and I was taken to the hospital where I received emergency surgery and stayed for 5 days. After my family's medical insurance I still owe $22k for the ambulance ride and my hospital stay. I'm supposed to be in physical and occupational therapy through december recovering from my injuries, which will likely be thousands more dollars after my insurance.

My personal injury attorney found that the driver was not insured on the day of the accident, and I don't have any auto insurance of my own because I don't have a car. He's helping me apply for No Fault Insurance in my state, which as I understand it, only will lead to the state paying my medical insurance back for some of what they paid on my behalf.

Reaching out to the hospital, they recommended I pay 350 a month for 60 months, which just doesn't feel financially feasible at all. They also informed me that I earn too much (>$3600/month) to quality for financial assistance or charity. They said they might be able to negotiate toward me paying $100/month for 220 months (18 years???) but that seems? Not right. 

Does anybody with a similar experience have recommendations for the best path forward? I've thought about ignoring it, but I don't want it to go to collections and ruin my credit.",,27,43,1fyd2bb
personalfinance,Dealing with $57K worth of debt at 22,"Hello, everyone I have also posted this to r/CRedit 

I'm facing a challenging financial situation, and I could really use your insights. A series of unfortunate events and some hasty decisions have led me to significant debt and financial stress.

# Quick Overview:

* **Total Debt:** $57,000
   * Credit Cards: $4,000
   * Student Loans: $6,000 (Luckily this isn't significant as I served in the Army & received TA)
   * Personal Loans: $10,000
   * Auto Loans: $30,000
   * Medical Expenses: $7,000

I currently earn $57,000 a year. Unfortunately, my pickup truck (purchased for $20,000) has a blown motor and transmission, which prompted me to buy a 2019 VW Jetta, further adding to my financial burden.

Recently, I moved back home to support my family after my mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness. I left a construction management job that paid $120,000/year to work with my father, who promised me $700 a week. After traveling across 5 states to get home and helping my father with the extra slack that was left by my mother not being able to work anymore, i ended up going unpaid for three months, I was in a tight spot. I used credit cards to cover living expenses over three months while searching for a way out, as my father threatened homelessness if I sought another job. While this was happening, I got into a motorcycle accident that causes significant damage and put a decent amount of medical bills on my list of things to deal with (I didn't have medical insurance at the time)

I've considered bankruptcy, however it feels a bit rash at the moment, even though I am neck deep in a shit show.

# My Current Situation:

* **Monthly Expenses:**
   * Rent: $550 (living with roommates)
   * Car Insurance: $200 (due to Michigan’s no-fault laws)
   * Food: $300 (I cook at home)
   * Gas: $90 (The Jetta gets great mileage; I commute roughly 50 miles round trip each day)

I recognize that most of this is entirely due to my own rashness and ignorance, please do not further add to my shame. I'm reaching out for advice on how to regain control of my finances and any strategies that have worked for others in similar situations.

Thank you for your time and any guidance you can share!",,3,10,1fyd1y2

personalfinance,Am I in over my head here?,"I just turned 25. I make $26hr. Comes out to about $3,100 a month, take home. I have about $8,000 saved up, did that over the past year. I still currently live at home, I have about $500 a month in expenses which includes a car payment ( I have the cash to pay off), car insurance, phone bill, and pet care.

I want to buy my own home. Doesn’t have to be anything special

I want/need a new truck. My current vehicles, a car and truck, have 200k miles each and they are 22 and 30 years old. They aren’t super reliable.

My idea for a home is to buy some land (would need a loan for this) and build a shed home. I expect the land to cost anywhere from $30k to $60k. As far as the shed home, the one I like is $31,000 and that includes installation. I would also need a construction loan to pour concrete for the home to sit on and also for the electrical and plumbing. Not sure of the exact cost this would add up to, I’m guessing around $10k.

As far as a truck. I have my eye on one that is $29,000. I can put $7,000 down now, this gives me enough left over to pay off my current car. I will sell it privately as I think I will get more than the dealership will offer.

Is this a good plan? Or am I in over my head? I know I’m not rich and I’m trying to live within my means. But I want my own things and I’d like to have a nice vehicle that I feel comfortable taking on long drives.
Idk much about getting loans and all that, my car is the only loan I’ve ever had. I have no debt outside of what I owe on my car and like I said I can pay it off.

I have a question that might be stupid, so I apologize in advance. I am currently on leave from my full-time W-2 job and I will be returning in November. I am currently being paid half on W-2 and half on a 1099.

I am unable to make 401K contributions until I return in November, does it make sense to do something crazy like contribute 50% of my first paycheck back to my 401K to: A. Catch up on missed contributions, B. Bolster my taxes paid so that I don't get absolutely roasted on self-employment tax. Etc.

I have some money now and I've been thinking what to do with it, nominally CDs and savings accounts. My bank only offers 1% on savings and CDs require 2500 minimum for 2%, which if I've done my math right isn't even $100 at 3 or 6 months

$2500 is also my sum total funds. So I was thinking I could refinance my car, credit karma shows $100 savings per month with less overall interest paid. Then I thought credit card, credit karma's outstanding approval is credit one platinum. I don't know how cash back rewards work though or any other features about the card. I'm thinking of paying every bill i can on the credit card, maintaining my singular bank account that's checking with 2500 minus some money to lower principal when i refinance while stacking my paychecks on top, saving money and living frugally while exclusively using the credit card and potentially find better CDs or other some such option than what my bank offers, then paying my credit card once a month with a variance ideally in my favor, thus allowing me to buy groceries and gas whenever I want without worrying about not spending a certain amount of money

Would this be a good way to also handle unexpected expenses? Reserving say a month's worth of bills and normal purchases, then the remainder being 1 part nest egg and 1 part capital for savings, all of which will be refreshed by my income? 

If so what would be the best way to set that up, should I have multiple accounts for: money to afford credit card, nest egg emergency fund, capital savings, and what type of accounts would they be? 

And please any tips on the credit cards that would work best for me. I spend a few hundred a month on groceries per month and ~45 a week on gas.

I’ve built up some money in a Roth IRA, 401k, and a brokerage account. I also have a 529 that should cover the rest of my tuition and other college expenses. 

Brokerage:
I have about 40k in mutual funds and will soon be adding 20k more. I am worried about dividends from  stocks complicating my taxes. Specifically VDADX and VTSAX, since I have want my tax bracket to stay low.

401k:

I've given the eldest of the three a rundown on how finances work (like what a HYSA is, what budgeting looks like on excel, IRA) but I'm not sure if I've done enough. My parents will not be of any help at all.

Do you think this second-hand exposure to all this Dave Ramsey and Caleb Hammer stuff I have turned on in my car all the time helps them? They do quip in sometimes saying ""oh this man/woman's stupid"" or something, so I think they listen from time to time. I'm not quite sure.

I don't think they'll watch or listen if I force them to either, so it's really all just second/third hand exposure. Should I be doing sth more??",1728346595.0,1,3,1fymw0r

Need a new truck, generally hold onto my vehicles for 10+ years, current is 13 - it's time to get into something new. Chevy is offering 0% APR for 36 month, total ""loan"" would be 45k.

We have the cash on hand to make the purchase outright - but I would sooner take advantage of the 0% APR loan, and put the 45k into an investment vehicle that has good liquidity, and ""make money"" on the loan.

I'm considering either using a HYSA or Money Market Fund to hold the funds for the three year term, and transfer payments out of the account as we go along. I'm not well versed in this though, and could use some suggestions. I do not want something high risk - this needs to be low risk and easy liquidity so that I can pull out and pay off the loan if shit happens to hit the fan.

Is there anyway i can get the 5.99? Am i in the wrong asking for this? Like is that how it should be? Or the latest financing rate should apply?

personalfinance,Bond ETFs - Why are they dropping after the Fed cut rates?,"Relatively new to most things investing and am still conducting my own research but can't figure this one out. From what I understand about bond prices is that their movement is inversely related to the movement of interest rates so you're better off buying bonds when interest rates are high and you expect them to lower in the future.

As for Bond ETFs, they are funds that hold multiple bonds of varying grades, maturities, types etc. A Bond ETF will have a target average maturity that is maintained by the fund manager as they buy new bonds and sell off old ones.

Therefore, my thoughts were that given the current high interest rates and the expectation that the Fed will cut and continue to cut rates over the next year or two, it would make sense to invest in Bond ETFs now. Additionally, it would make sense to invest in funds that have a duration of say 1-4 years which would capture the higher interest rates seen recently and would hold their value over the next few years even though rates are dropping then you could switch to a longer duration fund depending on the timeline of your goals and when rates reach neutral or lower.

However, what I'm seeing is ALL Bond ETFs (BND, BNDX, LTL, VTEB, MUB, AGG etc) have dropped after the fed announced their 50 basis point cut, including long and short duration ETFs, corporate, municipal, and government bond ETFs. I know bond ETF prices are determined by the market like any other security that is publicly traded but shouldn't Bond ETFs be a more attractive investment to everyone as the rates drop?

personalfinance,What to do with my auto lease,"Hi all:  

I have a Volvo Xc40 Recharge (electric) that I love. We leased it July 2023 and got 12,500+ in rebates, which we wouldn't have gotten if we had purchased it. We live in a high gas cost area and I have a 50 mile a day commute when kids aren't factored in.

Now that we've had it for a year we want to keep it.  Buyout is $43,000.  Purchase at end of lease is $28k. Trade in cost is $30000 for the vehicle.  We have $17000 in cash to put towards the buyout and we have secured an approval for the gap amount from our credit union. I didn't realize how much it had depreciated until I checked the carfax on my vehicle and I double checked through Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book.

My question is - with such severe depreciation does it make more sense to keep it for the duration of the lease (where we will spend $30k on lease payments) and then see what it is worth after that (I would assume much less?).  Or should we proceed with the buyout now? Can we negotiate the buyout at all after a year, or will they only negotiate when the lease is over?

Thanks!

personalfinance,I have no idea how I could save for retirement outside of 401k (which isn’t enough) due to household income. ,"I want to express that my husband and I recognize our good fortune with a household income of $300k, but I regret some financial decisions we've made.

Background: 

I'm 31 and my husband is 34. Although our income seems high, our savings and retirement plans are concerning, especially with a baby on the way. Earlier this year, we depleted our savings to pay off debts like student loans and car payments, leaving us with only our mortgage (still owe $100k). 

My husband graduated at 23 and reached a salary of over $80k, but he had $40k in student debt and didn’t start saving until about 4-5 years ago due to limited financial literacy. I graduated at 25, only earning a salary (60k) after covering school expenses. As a result, both of us began contributing to retirement and savings later in life, starting slowly as we built an emergency fund and because we bought a house.

Finances:

Now I make around $126k & husband makes $175k. Bring total household income before tax at = $301k

Debt: We emptied most of our savings at the beginning of this year because we both had large jumps in salary and something got messed up on our w4’s (we work at the same company) and owed 10k in taxes, we paid off our student loans, the siding of our house, our car note (we have 1 car for now until baby comes), etc. 

Savings: We penny pinched and now we are at 30k for savings and 10k for upcoming baby expenses for the next year. We both work in Tech and with layoffs constantly happening we’ve been advised to save as if one of us could not find a job for a year. 

Retirement: I only have $74k in 401k, and was only able to save 10k in Roth/traditional IRA. My husband has 100k in 401k (nothing else). I keep seeing you need 1x your salary in retirement before 30 to stay on track IF we still have social security (which I can’t count on). 

Household expenses: We’re remote employees so moved to a new state and got a 2 year lease to see if we wanted to permanently move (but we’ve decided to move back to our home to save money). We’re required to have our own offices with a lock so we’re trying to buy a new home with baby coming (current home is a 2 bedroom turned 3 (dinning room was turned into a bedroom). 

Mortgage: $1000

Rent (until March 2025): $ 3000

Total Utilities: $ 350

Car/house/renters insurance: $ 337
Internet: $ 100

Subscriptions (includes pet insurance, gym, Costco, apple care, cancer insurance, and streaming): $ 283

Misc bills: $1900

Total expenses for now= $6970

Total expenses once we move back to our house in March = $ 3970 (not included extra baby stuff and new car note).

Concern: I feel like there are no additional options for savings outside of our 401k and just a HYS account. We jumped salaries kinda quickly (before we even knew anything about financial literacy) so we never took advantage of IRAs before we legally  no longer could contribute to them without being double taxed. High yield savings accounts don’t build wealth, and I don’t see us ever being able to retire. Especially because we plan to pay for our child’s college so they can have a better start at life than we did (especially a better life than me because I grew up dirt poor, like my family wouldn’t be able to eat or go to the doctor without us having lived in a super awesome state that had generous social services). 

We have a good savings potential but realistically it’s not enough to grow the way a retirement account would. We’re learning about finances as we go along and had no guidance but the internet. What are our options? 

Edit (1): Forgot to mention we both have medical issues that will not make retirement age less costly even if a home is paid off. They will get worse with age and husband will most certainly need a heart transplant later in life. Luckily nothing we’d pass on to baby but still stinks!",1728340024.0,1,57,1fykjy0

Where do I start?,"Hi everyone, I am a college student who has recently been doing a lot of research on how to be good with money and build wealth throughout life.

I am a freelance musician in addition to a student, and would say that I try to average about $600-700 per month in income, although that can vary widely. So far, I have a $1000 emergency fund in a savings account with my local credit union, and $5000 in a higher yield savings account (4.6%).

Not really interested in anything too hands on or volatile, as I recognize I just don't have the time or knowledge to do well with anything like that lol.

I can handle around a 2k mortgage payment at the moment. 

These questions are meant to paint a picture of how lost I am rather than to be necessarily answered:

Should I avoid selling?  Can I get a decent home loan with say 250,000 to 300,000 down?  Should I?  The realtors said you can’t avoid capital gains tax even if you buy a new home with the money.  Is that true?  Should I keep the duplex and ask my parents to buy her out?

In May I financed my first car and with that my bills went up by about $500 and at the same time I had some personal expenses come up that totaled around the same amount. Thus, I have been behind in my bills by about $500 since May. I have been able to make ends meet using things like Earnin but payday loans are just slowly making the gap bigger and bigger. I want to get caught up so that I can get back to enjoying life. This has taken a huge toll on my mental health, and it seems impossible to even come close to breaking even at the end of the day. I haven’t been able to qualify for any credit cards or loans because I just took out the loan for the car and because I have a credit card that I maxed out and have only been able to make the minimum payment on because of all this mess. 
What can I do to get caught up? I’ve cut all of my extra expenses so the only time I’m spending money outside of bills is the necessities like gas, cat food/ litter, bathroom supplies, etc. and I basically only go to the dollar store to get them.

personalfinance,"33 years old and need advice: How can I better align my savings, brokerage, and retirement accounts with my goals? ","Hi all,

Unfortunately, I probably should have gotten started on my financial journey much sooner and been much more diligent about it. That said, I'm glad that I'm at least starting now.

I wanted to see what your thoughts about my current plan is, and what I could be doing better or differently.

**Here are some stats:**

* Age: 33 years old
* High Yield Savings Account: $12k, plan on contributing $1k monthly
* Salary: \~ $123k per year
* 401k: $57k (Traditional/Roth Split), plan on contributing 16% of my paycheck (Roth deferred) so about $1170 monthly
* Roth IRA: $4.7k, contributing \~ $580 monthly to max out
* Vanguard Brokerage: Hope to contribute $1000 monthly
* Monthly expenses: \~ $3400, includes living expenses, and some discretionary spending
* Fairly HCOL (Oakland, Bay Area)

**Goals of mine:**

* I'd like to own a home by the time I'm 40 years old.
* My partner and I would like to have a child eventually. She is a bit older than me, so it would probably have to be within the next 3-5 years.

**Other info:**

* My partner is in a relatively low-paying job (especially for the HCOL area) with a salary of roughly $60k per year.
* She will be applying to PhD programs soon, and expects to take out student loans for school. I completely support this, as it's an investment for the future, but of course that also means debt that she and I would be paying off.

**Questions:**

* Am I on track to be comfortably retired one day?
* What's a good figure I should aim for in retirement?
* Is there a point when I should stop contributing to my HYSA and just start investing, or is it best to continually split my money between the HYSA and a brokerage account?
* Does it make sense to prioritize my more immediate goals by investing less in my retirement accounts, and more into my savings and brokerage accounts?
* I figure I'll be working until my mid 60s, but if there's a way for me to maximize my savings and investments to potentially retire earlier, then I'd love to know.
* What generally do you see that might be an issue, or what can I do better?

personalfinance,Is it worth it to pay taxes to convert a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA to unlock the backdoor Roth?,"I'm in my late-30s and earn ~$280k/year. I have a fully-funded, 6-month emergency HYSA. Between my pre-tax 401k contributions, employer 401k match, and mega-backdoor Roth, I max out my 401k retirement account every year ($69k). I also have a regular, taxable brokerage account that I regularly contribute to (VOO and chill, mostly) and I plan on leaving that sit until retirement.

I would like to do a Roth IRA via the backdoor Roth method, but I can't do that because I have a traditional IRA. My 401k plan does not allow a ""reverse rollover"" of the traditional IRA to the 401k because I have made post-tax contributions to it (it was like 5 years ago and I regret that now, but oh well). 

The balance of the traditional IRA is about $200k and $12k of it is post-tax contributions.

So my question -- is it worth taking the tax hit to convert the Trad IRA to a Roth IRA so I can do the backdoor Roth? Or should I just be happy with what I have and this is optimization is not really worth it? If did the conversion, I would likely pay the taxes via my bonus (a large portion of my pay is a yearly bonus).

I'm not sure how to weigh the cost of paying the taxes now for tax-free growth later and being able to contribute more to that tax-free growth OR just leaving things as they are.

personalfinance,University experience or Save Money,"F19. I’m currently in my second year of university studying psychology and neuroscience. I was never certain on what career plan I wanted to pursue after I graduate, but I’ve recently been considering become a nurse. My school doesn’t have a nursing program I can switch to, and I’m left with 3 options.

Option 1) Move back back to my home town and do a nursing program there in the university (it’s a 2 year program that runs 3 terms so you finish fast asf because they are short on nurses).

Pros:
- Save a lot of money as the cost of living in my home town is very cheap compared to where I am now
- Finishing the program in 2 years which will fast track me into a career as nurses are very in demand in Canada.

Cons:
- Leave my university town which I love, essentially missing out on the “university experience”
- End my lease on my place that I stay with 2 of my other friends and they might be pissed at me because they will be assigned a stranger to live in my room to fill up the slot which I don’t think they will appreciate
- Go back to my home town which made me depressed living 


Option 2) Switch to another school which offers the nursing program in my university town which means I will start at square 1. I will be a first year student, while my friends will be going into their 3rd years. Also the school isn’t very reputable as it’s a college and in Canada, Universities are looked as “higher standard” here

Pros:
- Keep living in my apartment with my friends and enjoying the university experience
- The nursing program

Cons:
- It’s a College and while college is not bad, there is a bit of a stigma around that particular college
- Starting at square one while my mates will be in Year 3


Option 3) Finish my program (psychology and neuroscience) and then do an accelerated nursing program in a school that provides it

Pros:
- I get to graduate with my mates and have the university experience

Cons:
- The accelerated nursing program is pretty competitive to get into usually only take about 80 to 100 applicants in on average (depends on which school I choose)
- Kind of feels useless to spend all that money on my psychology and neuroscience degree, on top of that the accelerated nursing program  


Any advice is helpful. I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing. My biggest fear is making the wrong choice and then regretting it after I graduate. I love my program but it just isn’t very lucrative unless you have a masters, and if I want to work after I graduate really the only positions I can get are research positions which the pay is less than 80k.

I am considering taking the $16k contributions and $4k of my savings and just paying my car off, and then using the $350 per month and adding that to my contributions to maximize the 50% match.

I spent my 20s building my corporate career and working multiple side jobs to get to where I am now, and I want to relax a bit. Now I want to maximize my money and investments to plan for my personal and financial goals. I tried a financial advisor for a year but since my taxes are simple it wasn't worth the cost to me. They weren't really managing my investments and honestly I felt I was paying for someone to validate that I live within my means and have a reasonable budget. They felt like a financial coach more than anything, even though they were a fiduciary.

Here's what I'm considering:

1. Consolidate my old retirement accounts into one IRA. Would you go with a traditional IRA or Roth IRA?
2. Can I max out both annual contribution limits to a Roth IRA and an employer-sponsored Roth?
3. Instead, should I switch from employer Roth to employer 401k (my company offers both options) so I meet income requirements for a Roth IRA? And then max out both my employer 401k and a Roth IRA annually? Would this also be wise since I expect to retire or semi-retire on less income than I'm earning now?

personalfinance,Weighing options of paying off credit card debt. ,"Currently have about $17k in debt in one Amex blue cash everyday card after making some purchases for travel and other necessary expenses after a family member passed away. I make about $85k/year and am able to save about $800-900 each month for credit card payments, depending on how much I can budget with other living expenses (minimum payment per month is $578). I live with my girlfriend and we split rent which is why I can spread out some of my weekly income for credit card payments. When I used a debt calculator, it would take me close to 3 years to pay off my credit card with about $800 a month in payments. 

My credit card has really high interest rates, and was wondering if it would be best to take out a personal loan with low interest to pay off my credit card to reduce the time it takes to pay off the debt in total? 

It seems that the money I’m putting towards my credit card is barely putting a dent into it, and I’d love to pay it off sooner if I can but I can’t put any more than $900 a month towards it since I have other living expenses. My credit score is around 740 and I never miss payments, so my credit score has been relatively stable. I would still love to pay off my credit card debt sooner in any way if possible since all the money I’m paying towards this could be used towards my savings. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,How Can I Escape My Financial Rut?,"How Can I Escape My Financial Rut?

I’m currently living and working in the Middle East, originally from Zimbabwe, and I feel like I’m stuck in an endless cycle with no clear direction. My parents, both retired, depend on me and my brother for support since they don’t have a stable income. I also help my younger brother who’s in his second year of university, contributing to his tuition fees from time to time.

I earn around $500 a month. After sending $150 home, I’m left with $350. My employer provides accommodation, food, and transportation, which helps reduce my personal expenses. On average, I spend about $50 on groceries and $100 if I go out, leaving me with around $200 in savings in a good month.

I have a background in accounting and finance and have been trying to transition back into this field without success. I’ve gone through six interviews, and five of them led to the offer stage. Unfortunately, I couldn’t proceed further due to visa requirements, as most EU countries require a degree, which I don’t have. Despite my experience, these opportunities fall through, leaving me stuck in my current job.

The financial situation at home weighs heavily on me. As my parents age, the pressure to improve their circumstances builds. It’s affected me mentally, making me more withdrawn. I often feel guilty spending money on myself when I know my parents are struggling back home.

I’ve taken steps to improve my situation, like completing finance and accounting courses online, but none of them are accredited. Going back to school isn’t an option due to the high costs, and I can’t save enough to invest because of Zimbabwe’s economic instability. Additionally, side hustles are hard to come by, especially without access to my own transportation and living in a remote area.

I’m looking for advice on how to turn things around financially and break free from this cycle.",1728332661.0,1,0,1fyhmq8
personalfinance,Unique situation requiring unique expertise. Any advice?,"
So, this is all very vulnerable for me to share, but I’ve come to know, love, and trust the Reddit community over last few years. I feel safe sharing here now. Thank you to anyone reading, and especially those refraining from judgement!

I’d been in a super sh*tty financial situation for over ten years due to a chronic health condition. I need frequent bloodwork and take multiple medications daily. I also try to eat really clean and take supplements. It’s expensive staying healthy!

As a creative, I worked the gig economy for many years, and my low income status allowed me to receive medicaid, which kept my mounting medical expenses at zero (the older I get, the more secondary health complications I’m experiencing).

When I did finally get my first full time corporate job, I’d never been more broke due to the constant out of pocket copays and mandatory visits to specialist doctors (even with my employer contributing toward insurance, I was barely scraping by). I was more broke making money than not making money if that makes sense. 

Because of that experience, I’ve had a huge fear of being in that awkward middle zone between the low income threshold and less than, say, $85k yearly. 

I had a huge win about 4 years ago by working with a CPA who helped me escape this elective poverty. I was advised to form an LLC and file my taxes as a c-corp, which would allow me to pay myself low income wages while my business holds the rest of the income. I transferred all eligible assets to my business and expense as much as I legally can. This structure means I kinda end up paying double taxes, but I don’t mind since I’m receiving free medical care.

My business is making a bit more each year, and I’m chomping at the bit to stop paying rent and start building equity. I am close to having a down payment saved up, have zero debt, and excellent credit. However, in speaking with a mortgage broker recently, they said it simply wasn’t possible because my personal income doesn’t qualify me (which is wild, because rent is more than a mortgage and I’ve been paying rent for 15+ years). 

I think I’m at a point where I either need a non-conforming mortgage and/or my business needs to start covering my health insurance/retirement. I’m not even sure what my options are. I’m wondering if my business can buy a mixed commercial/residential property and rent the residence to myself. A friend recently mentioned that he formed a trust which has helped his unique situation, but his is different than mine and trusts are completely foreign to me (I don’t know if I even have enough money to qualify for one). I’m asking around and googling, but not finding the answers I need…

My retirement plan right now is basically… to just die 😂. It’s bleak, and sadly, I know I’m not alone in this situation. But at 35, I feel like I’m running out of time to get my shit together!! I would like to speak with some sort of financial specialist who can help me find another legal loophole or mortgage strategy to get me to the next rung on the ladder. But I don’t know who that person is or how to find them. Most services seem geared toward wealthy people or SBOs, but I don’t know that my business really qualifies. I’m more of an employee working as an independent contractor so that I avoid going medically broke again. My situation is better than it’s ever been, but I have to believe there’s something even better…

I’m a veteran who did not attend college, which is great for landing jobs with my experience but horrible for salary negotiations. (I.e. I need a degree / more certifications in order to be taken seriously in my field) I’m now enrolled in school pursuing a bachelors degree in business/finance while I also pursue a project management professional certification. The VA pays me a monthly housing allowance so long as I’m enrolled in school full time. Long story short - there was a miscommunication between my school and I, I thought I was enrolled in enough credits but I was 4 short. Because I was short those credits, the VA did not pay me my housing allowance this month. Something I was severely depending on. I have a bar job as well that I work on weekends or week nights after school. I made just enough at the bar job to pay my rent this month but I’m now left with less than a dollar in my bank account and 2 maxed out credit cards. I can’t afford my car payment either, considering a voluntary repo. 

I’m attending school Monday - Thursday and working Thursday - Sunday. No days off and I have no money. 

Additionally I cannot drop out of school because the VA would fine me the tuition they paid the school, leaving me with thousands more in debt

personalfinance,Merrill Lynch want to close my Black Rock portfolio (?) and wire me the money (I live abroad). What are my options?,"So, as the title says. When my younger sister wad born my parents opened an account in each of our names, a college fund. Al though we are citizens I've never officially lived in the US. (For a short while, 9-12 months when I was a kid we stayed in Florida where my mother recieved treatment at a hospital. She passed shortly after. As far as I know we didn't officially move there, just stayed.) 

For a long time the money just stood in a few different mutual funds (I think, I don't know much about finances.) I withdrew some of it 20 years ago, about 10k. 8 years ago, after having gone from Merrill Lynch to Black Rock and back again tl Merrill Lynch I had to go to a branch, ID myself and sign some papers and that was it. We made a vacation out of it so it was all good. 6 months ago I got an e-mail from my guy at Merrill Lynch, he wanted me to call him. I just kind of forgot and didn't hear anything untill today when I got a new e-mail and called them. Because I don't live where their branch is they said they wanted to close my account, sell the stocks/funds/whatever and wire the money to my bank. Fine I guess. 

The thing is, I don't really need this money and have always kind of liked the idea of having a safety fund in case I for some reason have to move to the US. Not likely in any case really, the country I live in (and also hold citizenship in) is a stable, highly functional democracy, and if anything I'd be more afraid that the US will go to hell before it does here. 

So, what do I do now? I don't really want to have to worry about following the marked and I can't be assed to get into crypto. Is there a financial institution I could put it into where the money will grow with a certain stability and be fairly safe? S&P500? How do I invest it there? We're talking like $7000-ish so it's not a huge sum but enough that I don't just want it sitting in a bank account, waiting for me to spend it on a new gravel bike and clothes. I have a young daughter so maybe some day it'll help her buy an apartment. 

I don't know if it matters but I've never sent a tax return to the US, though I think it's required my country has a higher tax rate than the US so regardless I would never ow taxes to the US.

personalfinance,Help - grandfather passed & mom received 25% from sale of house - what do we do?,"Looking for any and all help/advice!

My grandfather (my mother’s father) passed away recently. He knew his health was declining, and before he passed he tried to set some things up for my mother.

He had my mother sign to have 25% ownership of his house around 2010 after his wife (my mother’s mother) passed.
He remarried a few years after, started living with his new wife in a condo, but kept his house and used it as a rental property. His new wife was left everything in the will.
Before he passed he put his house up for sale, and it sold shortly after his passing.

We assume he did this to ensure my mother would get some amount of money because we are unsure how much his new wife will get from the will since he had a ton of medical problems later in life, and we were told that what was left from his estate would be used to cover any medical debt and things like that.

We have no issue with how these things played out really, but I am concerned about how to go about handling the money my mother received. My mother was wired 25% from the sale of the house within 24 hours of signing all the paperwork. I believe any and all taxes and fees were taken out before she was wired anything, but I’m not entirely certain.

My mother (55) is not very financially stable. To put it bluntly, she is poor and not financially literate. She has been living paycheck to paycheck for the past several years, and she only has a checking and savings account with the one bank she’s been with pretty much her whole life. She does not have any real savings and no investments or anything like that. Receiving this money from the sale of her father’s property is a huge blessing and a chance for her to have some sense of financial security and stability as she gets older.

My main questions are listed below, but I would love any and all advice and suggestions!

Paying off my mortgage vs. Investing in Index funds,"Hi, this has probably been answered many times, but I have been playing with some calculators, and I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. From what I can see, I can save a lot if I make the extra payments on my mortgage, rather than an index fund at 8% return.

My mortgage (Currency is in NOK)

* **Loan Amount**: 2,087,932 kr
* **Interest Rate**: 5.68%
* **Original Duration**: 28 years and 10 months
* **Extra Monthly Payment**: 5,000 kr
* **One-Time Extra Payment**: 300,000 kr

With these extra payments, my mortgage will be paid off in 11 years and 11 months, saving me 1.483,691 kr in interest.

# Investing in Index Fund

* **Annual Return**: 8%
* **Investment Duration**: 12 years (One month more than the mortgage)
* E**xtra monthly payment:** 5.000 kr
* **Extra one-time payment:** 300.000 kr
* **Total Interest Earned**: 963,558.71 kr

That's a difference of 520.132,29 kr (48.856.81 USD)

Am I missing something? I have never invested before, but I have been considering an index fund, but from these calculations it seems to be better to invest after the mortgage is paid off?

So... Let me preface by saying: I'm new to this. I started investing about a year ago. I currently have $9300 split over Stocks (60%) and ETF's (40%). My plan is to invest $9000 a year (an amount that I hope increases with my salary over time) for the next 25 years.

At the moment, the majority of my money (37.66%) is in Vanguard S&P500. I also have (1.18%) JEPQ and (1.28%) JEPI.

As a result, I will have an easier time determining whether the company is positioned for growth and profitability, as well as any obstacles it might face in the future.

Once every 6 months, I plan to make plans to sell or buy more of these stocks according to intuition and each company's earnings per share, price-to-equity ratio, price-to-sales ratio and debt-to-equity-ratio

so the car was:

$32,365 (3.72% apr, 60mo lease)

i'm currently at $16,164 remaining, no missed payments.

now for the stress, i decided to go to grad school so i quit my job in august lol. its a phd program so i'm getting paid a stipend to go. 

so now, im making 48k/yr (pre tax, new york)... but now im living in nyc so i didnt even bring my car here, unlucky. 

anyway so the monthly payment is ~$600, my car insurance is ~$140 (fuck geico they keep raising it for no reason it was literally $90 last year) and my rent is ~$2100 (utilities, wifi, etc all covered by school since housing is subsidized). 

i'm currently paying my rent w/ some money i put in one of those education accounts (since i didnt use it for undergrad, state school, full ride) w/ high interest but i only have enough to last until dec/jan.

i have 20k in high yield savings (4.25%), around 8k in checking and another 3k in my regular bank savings for emergencies. 

so i know i made a lot of mistakes, but hey at least i saved some money i guess. should i just pay it off in full or take money out of my high yield account to keep paying it. it all just feels really daunting. 

also idk if it matters but im 24, and have no other debt, credit score is a 799.",1728401421.0,1,4,1fz2lef
personalfinance,Why does compound interest matter when most of my investments in stocks/mutual funds don't pay interest?,"Might be a dumb question, but I've always wondered this.

Lots of people talk about how important it is to always be regularly investing and building up as early as possible, since doing it early lets you benefit the most from compounding interest effects.

But a mutual fund (which is the number 1 investment everyone recommends) doesn't pay interest (from my understanding).  Why do people keep talking about compound interest?",1728401406.0,1,5,1fz2l6h

personalfinance,What’s one financial mistake you made that taught you a valuable lesson?,"One financial mistake I made was overspending on a brand-new car right after college. I was so excited about getting my first ""grown-up"" vehicle that I didn't fully consider my budget or the long-term costs associated with owning a car, like insurance, maintenance, and gas.

Initially, the thrill of having a shiny new car was exhilarating, but I quickly realized how much of my monthly income was going toward that payment. It restricted my ability to save for other important things, like travel or emergencies. To make matters worse, within a year, I discovered that the car depreciated significantly in value, which was a tough pill to swallow.

The lesson I learned was to prioritize needs over wants and to always consider the total cost of ownership, not just the purchase price. Now, I focus on making more informed financial decisions, like saving up for larger purchases and considering used options that offer more value. I also keep a budget to ensure I live within my means and save for the future.",1728401063.0,5,7,1fz2gd8

personalfinance,Almost bought a house that could’ve crippled me financially ,"TLDR: Almost overextended myself on a house I can afford CURRENTLY

I work a full time job (high earning) and have a few side hustles which have brought consistent income for 2+ years. I was able to qualify for an insanely high mortgage loan because of my side hustle income + W2. Even if I quit my side hustles and got big promotions at the W2 it would not equal the income level I am at now. I would likely take a pay cut on the way to the top. 

The problem with the side hustle is that it is not scalable and likely temporary (a few more years perhaps before I burn out). It takes everything out of me mentally and physically to keep it going and means I am spending less time with my family. I don’t see myself being able to do it forever.

I could’ve sold some from my brokerage and/or my existing property to put a larger down payment but that still wouldn’t have made a big enough dent on the mortgage payment from my full time income to get it to a comfortable level. 

I was looking at 90% of my take home pay from my full time income as my mortgage expense. It would’ve been manageable if I keep doing the side gigs.

I would’ve had to keep the side gigs going forever and not been able to relax. What right now is the cherry on top of my income for vacations, child care etc… would’ve now become essential to survive. I didn’t want to walk away from my sub 3% interest rate in my current home.

The house I could’ve had? 800 more square feet, the same school district, 10 minute walk away, 2 extra rooms, pool, big pantry, and half bath. A “luxury” home that is worth double what my current house is. 

The mortgage would’ve been a bit more than 3x my current mortgage.

We live comfortably right now we can go on vacation whenever we desire, not need to stress about going out to eat, or paying for child care. We can save very heavily for retirement without concern. All of that would’ve been stretched so much more.

We will need to upsize our house at some point, but right now we’re comfortable.

Don’t be like me folks. Don’t FOMO into your dream home if you’re gambling for how long you can pay the mortgage and you’ve peaked in earning potential in your career.

Could I start a business one day and make more money and have been totally fine? Sure, but I wouldn't have had the time for that if I had to keep the side gigs going. Yes I can always earn more money without overextending MYSELF, but I wouldn't have had the time to do it with my current work load.",1728400260.0,0,4,1fz24uo
personalfinance,Saving for child with earned income - UTMA or Roth IRA?,"\*Sorry for rehashing this subject but I haven't been able to find an answer to my specific question in previous posts.\*

I'm in NY. My 5yo son booked a modeling job earlier this year and earned a sum of \~$1300 after taxes. NYS law required us to set up a Child Performer Trust Account...we chose a UTMA with Vanguard. According to the law, employers must deposit at least 15% of the performer's earnings into this account. Currently, 100% of his earnings are sitting in this account's settlement fund. 

I'm unfamiliar with UTMA accounts. Can I just buy vanguard mutual funds or ETFs as I would in a normal brokerage account, and is this the best course of action? Can I (should I) transfer some amount of funds to a Roth IRA for him? If so, how much am I allowed to remove from his UTMA? 

If I should leave his funds in his UTMA and buy, say, VFIAX, the minimum investment amount is $3000 - can I gift him the balance necessary to buy this? If so, what are the tax implications for all of this?

Thanks in advance for anyone willing to take the time to reply. I feel like I'm stuck in a paralysis by over-analysis loop.

personalfinance,Need Help Consolidating 401ks and Rolling Over to an IRA,"Hi everyone,

Over the past 10 years, I've switched jobs multiple times and accumulated several 401ks with different employers, but I've lost track of some of them. Recently, I used MeetBeagle to track them all down since I wasn’t sure how many I had floating around. Now I want to consolidate them into a single account to manage everything better.



# 401k Situation:

* One of my old 401ks, managed by **Fidelity**, automatically invested me in the **FID FREEDOM 2055 K6** fund. I’m not sure what this fund is, and I didn’t pay much attention to the details at the time.
* Another 401k, managed by **Empower**, had me invested in **Vanguard Target Retirement 2055**. Again, I didn’t look into it too much but noticed the returns were decent.



# My Mindset:

I’ve had more of a “set it and forget it” approach when it comes to my 401k investments, but now I’m thinking more seriously about getting everything in one place. The funds seem to have done okay, but I want to be more intentional about managing my retirement savings moving forward.



# What I’m Looking To Do:

I’m considering rolling over all these 401ks into a **Roth IRA** (or traditional IRA) with **Fidelity** to make things simpler to manage. But here’s where I need help:

1. **Should I keep the old 401ks separate or roll everything into one IRA?**
2. **If I roll over into an IRA, what happens to the current investments like Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 and FID FREEDOM 2055?** Do they transfer over, or do I need to select new funds?
3. **Fidelity Options**: I see that Fidelity offers multiple investment options. Should I:
   * Let a **Fidelity advisor** manage everything for me?
   * Opt into **index funds** or target-date funds on my own?
   * Choose individual stocks/bonds?

I’m not sure where to start and feel a bit overwhelmed by all the options. Any advice on how to approach this rollover, how to handle the funds, or what type of investments would work best would be super helpful.

I'm not sure where to start on this.  I work for a small company in the US located in Wisconsin.  Technically my role is in management, but it never feels like that. I am not sure what my local, State or Federal Laws are on this or what my actions should be to get this resolved.   I am paid monthly, and its looking like my employer has been taking 401k contributions out of my payroll but that money has not been making it into my 401k account.   Q2 and Q3 year shows zero contributions, and Q1 has some money on it.   The panel for last deposit in the 401k shows Jan 5th being the last addition.   Further more in 2023, it looks like Q3 had no additions either, but taking the total, and dividing it out looks to be somewhat accurate.  Friends indicated that could be that the company is only doing contributions twice a year, but i can't look at more 2 years of statements so I can't confirm that. 

I spoke with someone who handles Payroll and accounts payable who said shes had others asking about similar things and was going to reach out to the Rep who handles our account directly.   I don't have direct knowledge of that individual or contact information, so I've reached out to the platform via the contact us page.   Some of the comments that the person in payroll said made it sound like the company isn't paying the investment group, but i have no direct knowledge of that.

First option - Sell the house for around £180,000 and I would get back around £83,000 cash. I would use this cash/deposit to go get a mortgage somewhere in Europe. 

Second Option - Keep the house and rent it out, same houses are renting for £900/month. I would use £20,000 savings to get a mortgage and buy in Europe. This would allow me to finish my mortgage in 10 years time (by reducing term/increasing payment), after 10 years I would then own the house and have around £200,000 in cash (inflation of house price) but also be on my way to owning a second house in Europe.

Any advice or opinions? Some people say get rid of the house and get the cash. Some people say to keep house and rent it out and get a second mortgage abroad.

personalfinance,401k Conversion Question,"Hey all!

I realized later that when I initially started working I should have invested my 401k into a Roth 401k rather than the traditional based on my current income bracket at the time.

I recently remembered that I could do a conversion and was wondering how that would work and if the taxes were worth taking the hit on for the year.

I believe that I have around 20k (give or take) in a traditional 401k and make around 80k annually. I am also no longer a student as I have finished grad school.

Would it be worth converting the traditional pre-tax dollars to my Roth 401k given that I am in my mid 20s and would expect to be making over 6 figures in the next 2-5 years? If so, how would I go about doing this? (I assume I can just call fidelity to initiate) And how much in taxes should i expect to pay to ensure I am able to cover it come April?

personalfinance,Need some advice on a mortgage loan ,"Mortgage loan

I am a 23 year old making around 55k a month and my parents are giving me an offer. They want me to apply for a mortgage loan under me and my dad in order to buy a house, a co-loan. I have no debt nor any loans and they claim they want to buy a house in California under my name in order to build equity. I on the other hand will be moving to Hawaii for 3 years where I will be most likely renting over there. I work for the military so I get BAH benefits and things like that. We agreed that I would help contribute $1,000 monthly and that they would cover everything else. At the end of all of this, when they move out and retire, they said I can owe the house and I can do with it whatever I please (live, sell, etc.) What are your thoughts? I have around 10k in savings. I’d like to know what everybody’s thoughts are as I know I have heard bad things about applying for loans with your parents, but it seems like a good offer. 

Edited: Further information, they are trying to move out of our current neighborhood as the rent is ever increasing which is why they want to buy a house. Buying a house would slightly be more expensive but overall the situation would be better compared to renting. My parents have additional loans but they have assured me they can cover it. They both work as nurses. An example of their good payments would be that my dad had a $54,000 loan for a Tesla for only a year and he’s been paying it off so now he has a balance left of about $6,800.",1728350454.0,1,2,1fyo6j6

I need help or some advice please. I was in an abusive relationship and racked up like $30k in CC debt that was all charged off like a year ago. I make good money I think ($100k/year in a super HCOL area — but I’m out of work for a few months on disability) but am just horrible with my finances. The only thing I’m not terrible about is retirement savings. Between my Roth IRA, 403b and 401k, I have almost 800k saved. I have an additional $200k in a brokerage account. The credit card companies (5 of them) are all trying to settle with me. I was so depressed I just ignored everything and thought it would just go away after 7 years. Wrong! Ugh. My dad was very financially abusive growing up so I think it impacts my ability to function well moneywise. Anyway, my credit ranges from low 600 to high 500s. So what’s the best thing for me to do at this point? I can’t afford to pay my shit off with my regular paychecks, it would take several years. Should I sell like $20k of stock from the brokerage account and settle everything out? Is there a way to pay a higher amount if they clear it from my credit report? Do I need to pay the full amount owed or the negotiated lower rates since the accounts are already closed and charged off and they are offering me settlement amounts? Also if I sell stocks, when/how do I pay the taxes on the gains? I just want to get out from under this crippling debt that’s haunting me. I’ve been living on debit just fine the last year or so. I’d like to be able to buy a house someday or get a new car. I’m so embarrassed about the state of my affairs that I can’t ask anyone in my real life for help or advice.

personalfinance,Finances during a leave of absence from work ,"Hi guys. 

I’m writing here to get some input from you about my situation. English is not my first language, so please bear with me as this will be a long read. 

To start, I’m not American. I am located in Northern Europe, but hope that your advice and input will still apply. 

I (23F) currently work full time as a pension customer service rep at a bank. Im also doing a bachelors in economics on the side with 1.5 years left until graduation. Without going into too much detail because it’s boring to read about, my work is literally killing my will to live. I despise it. I have been discussing options in my mind for some time now, and this is the best alternative I can come up with. 

I want to take an unpaid leave of absence from work for a year (August 2025-August 2026) to solely focus on my last year of university. I will not be eligible for any grants or scholarships (it’s not really a thing in my country), and will have to live off of student loans and savings. My financial situation looks like this: 

- Own an apartment with my partner, 50/50. Monthly mortgage payment of 685$ for my half. Mortgage through the bank I work in at 4.6% APR. 
- Currently 6.6k $ in my emergency fund 
- 22k $ invested in broad market index funds. 
- 10k $ in a high yield savings account, the money is inaccessible in return for a higher APR. Can’t withdraw until the end of next year. 
- 400 $ in a private target date retirement index fund. I save 30$ a month in that fund specifically for my retirement. I also have a defined contribution scheme pension at work, but can’t access that money. 
- No CC or consumer debt. Only mortgage and 18k $ in student loans. I already have a bachelors in sociology. Completely useless. 

Note that I converted the money from my currency to dollars, without adjusting for purchasing power differences. 

If I take a leave of absence, I will still technically be employed at my bank and keep all my employee benefits for the period (lower interest rate on the mortgage, higher interest rate on savings accounts, healthcare, insurance etc) which is a big plus. 

I would have to life off of student loans and my savings for that year. Student loans will pay out about 1.4K $ a month, and I estimate to have to withdraw maybe 4-500$ from my savings monthly as well to survive. 

My question is: 
- What do you guys think? Is this a viable option, or am I fucking myself over financially here?  
- I’m considering extending the term of the mortgage for that period, that would lower my monthly payment down to about 590$. I know the bank will make more money off of me for doing that, but at the same time the interest rate is not the worst so.. what do you think?
 
- Should I stop the retirement index fund contributions of 30$/month for that period? Would this it have a big impact on the compound growth in 40/50 years? 

- Should I make the withdrawals from my index funds monthly, or take out a bigger sum in a one-time withdrawal, and place it in a savings account? What is the smartest way to go about this? I know that index funds are volatile, but at the same time if I take out a bigger sum at once I will loose the return on that money if the market does well. 

To preface, changing jobs is not an option right now. I’ve applied to several other internal positions at the bank without luck, but I can’t apply outside of my current company because of several reasons. Financial security is really important me, but my mental health matters as well. I really need the time off to recoup and mentally recover, as well as focusing on my degree. I hope my degree will open the door for other and better positions in the future, not in customer service. 

Is this viable? I want to do this the most correct way possible without impacting my future too much. Is there something important I have overlooked in my plans? Please provide your input and advice, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",1728373633.0,0,2,1fyuf56

I have about $285k in retirement accounts. Most of it invested in S&P 500. Should I start being more conservative or wait until I am closer to retirement?

I have no other investment accounts yet.

personalfinance,Sell 2014 Chevy Cruze that needs catalytic converter that’s under warranty or keep? ,"I have a 2014 Chevy Cruze that needs a catalytic converter replacement. To my surprise because of the “low” mileage (87k) the catalytic converter is under the emissions warranty since it has not been 15 years yet. I took it to the dealer and they approved a replacement at no cost to me (They would have charged around $2200 for parts and labor). This was March of this year, and that part has been back ordered with no updates whatsoever.  

The problem is my registration expired last month, and since it wouldn’t pass smog, I filed for a Non-op. Now I’m debating on keeping it and waiting for the part to come in (if it ever does) but since it’s been 8 months, the car will just be sitting there not in use. 

Car was paid off originally at 17k, but I refinanced to borrow 9k. The interest was low (1.74%) so I basically took out a loan for $300 in interest for the life of the loan. I owe $2k and can easily pay it off. 

I was fortunate where I have been able to borrow an EV car from a family member and am in the process of purchasing that car as it’s been great in gas savings since I have a crazy long commute.  My husband and I commute together as he has a job in the same city. So I don’t need an extra car now, however in a couple of months my husband’s job location may change and he could use the second car. The problem is since the part is backordered it would be a moot point to keep it as it may or may not be operable. 

So I have a few options:

A) keep car, as I would not have to pay for a catalytic converter and my husband gets a second car depending on the part arriving soon. Auto shops nearby quoted me $1500-2300.

B) Bite the bullet and just pay for a catalytic converter to get more life out of it and not worry about getting a different used car should my husband need it. Out $1-2k when the car is worth about 5k-6k.

C)Finish paying car off (2k) and sell it to a private seller for maybe? 4-5K with the bad catalytic converter. IF anyone is actually willing to buy a ten year old car that needs a $1500-$2300 catalytic converter. Or sell it in general to a dealership/KBB etc for whatever the highest I can get which I also expect wouldn’t be much. 

I also know the car should be operated at least once every couple of weeks, to keep it in good shape but seeing as I have an NPO on it don’t see how I can do that.  Car has been great with minimal mechanical issues and in great condition. 

Any insight would be helpful!

personalfinance,Send help behind on payments ,"Hi guys, 5+ years ago, I, like many others, became homeless. I ended up living in my car with my 2 dogs. I couldn't find anyone to help me with a loan, no family or friends. I had a fantastic government job prior. Had a car loan. 20k .
When I became homeles,  I absolutely could not pay the loan. I did everything I could possibly do. I called them, did door dash , picked up jobs off of Craigslist, the labor gigs, found a over night gas station job, and finally started to get on my feet. 

A local lady said I could stay in her studio apartment as long as I helped her get her business going and she'd pay me to be a cook. Things finally started looking up, got her restaurant going, and business great. 4 months in and rent increased so much I could barely afford food again. I talked to her about it, and she asked me to leave because her son just got out of jail and was going to live in the studio apartment. I had nowhere to go again.

I'm still communicating with car loan place. Finally, I did enough door dash to be able to make a payment. They took it. 

Then the next time they refused and said there was no agreement and they were going to repo the car. Unfortunately it was all by phone because I had nowhere to get mail. I couldn't afford a post office box.

 I tried so incredibly hard to get my dogs into a rescue, and even several states away, I couldn't find a place for them to go. I felt hopeless and worthless. But that didn't stop me from trying.

 I have zero addictions to anything, I don't even smoke cigarettes. I just fell short, and my family turned their back on me because I chose to work a government job. They didn't approve. 

Fast forward like a couple months of barely making enough from door dash to feed myself, my dogs , stay warm in winter, and take $15 showers at truck stops to stay clean. It was usually around 10° -20° every night. 

I begged my parents to please let me come stay with them. I'd do anything. It was too cold and so expensive to keep the car running in winter. It was Thanksgiving and xmas time I made a lot doing door dash in Reno. They started to pay well. I'd make about $200 a week.

My family said yes I could come but had to sleep in my car with my dogs. Made me so upset they had 3 bedrooms and 5 beds available. But I could shower and bring food into prep. The door dash at my parents was terrible. Almost no side jobs. I'd make maybe $50 a week doing door dash. 

The car was up for repo. I told them where I lived. And kept in contact.

My mom told me about food stamps, and I applied , I never knew someone like me could get help. Because prior, I was making good money as a single lady with no kids. So, I started working with the state and finally was able to get food. 

I spent days, weeks, and even months at the employment office and had no luck. I felt hopeless again. Part of me wished I had gone back to Reno to Door Dash because at least I was making money. 

Trusted the process and didn't give up. Finally got a job and started to make money again. Got a small rental for my dogs, and I just in time before winter hit again. It was literally 1 month before snow.

I left the car at my parents' because I thought they were going to go get it. I was able to walk to work. So it wasn't that big of a deal. 

A few months go past, and I finally had another fantastic job, got a new place closer to work, a rental, and got a new 2024 car in April on a loan.

Each time I'd call my parents, the old car was never brought up, so I thought the bank took it back. 

I have never dealt with this and had no idea what to expect and what not to expect.

I thought the bank got the car, and I would only owe what wasn't made when it went to auction. That's what they told me when they said it was up for repo, and those were the steps. And since I haven't gotten anything in the mail at my new house, I thought it hadn't sold yet. It had been sitting in the same place for the last 4.5 years.

I had so much resentment towards my parents I stopped visiting them. 

2 months ago I decided to visit my parents. I thought they would be proud of me working so hard and getting another good job. But I guess they knew where I worked prior to me telling them, and that’s why they didn't reach out to me. Another government job. 

I guess sometime in the last year, my dad decided to drive it to town. After all, I left the key for the bank to get. I was told it broke down on the highway, my dad left it, and it got impounded. 

It had sat in the impound yard so long that someone had bought it. Now idk where it's at. I called the tow company and last I heard it was sold. But idk. 

On my credit report, it shows as a charge off/collection. What do I do? If it was owned by the bank , how did it get sold and registered? How can I owe on a car that's nowhere to be found? 

I have been looking online for what to do, but idk. Someone, please help me. I can't afford to have my wages garnished, and I don't want to go to jail. I don't even have a speeding ticket. 

What should my next step be?  I'm barely making it paycheck to paycheck.

personalfinance,How to handle outstanding balance after being told by billing that my account is current with former insurance for services from 1.5 years ago ,"
TLDR- today I just received a bill with outstanding balance from podiatrist from 1.5 years ago despite being told I have no balance and unclear how to handle. 

In May 2023, I went to an in network podiatrist for an ingrown toenail, and I received consultation for inserts for my work shoes and was asked to schedule a follow up visit for the procedure. I then went back 2 more visits (4 total) for the insole fittings and a post op check in- healing was great. At the time of my visit, I had anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, was on my family’s insurance and we had well exceed our deductible and had paid my copays for the visit.

A few weeks later, I checked on the anthem app and noticed I had several claims from them filed and I had a balance on the app I needed to settle. I called the office and spoke to reception and was told I was not marked for a balance and billing would call me if I needed to pay anything. Weeks go by, I never heard back, I left a voicemail and sent an email to the doctors office / billing and never heard back (after July 2023). 

Fast forward to October 2024, and I get a bill dated to a few weeks ago for an outstanding balance for close to 800. I never heard from them since that I owed anything, nor was I contacted? Additionally, it shows that they still continued to charge my insurance for repeat claim attempts despite that policy ending on 9/1/23, and my family switched to Cigna before now I’m on my own Aetna policy. 

Both the office and Anthem’s customer billing support line were closed after I got the bill in the evening, but my dad is suggesting I call anthem to have them straighten it out with the podiatrist. If the doctors / anthem are stubborn into not letting this slide I personally am  going to attempt to negotiate this bill to atleast half due to the 1.5 years late communication. 

My question is, should I handle this a different way? I’m just a little shocked that they didn’t try and contact me sooner for an outstanding balance of nearly 800? ",1728355242.0,1,2,1fypq2f

personalfinance,Would it be dumb to spend 20k on a car when I want to buy a house in the next 5-7 years?,"30m here. I currently make about 150k a year, I live with a roommate and my share of the rent is about $1900 a month. My car is paid off and I don’t really spend frivolously. There’s a car I’ve wanted my entire life and you can find them used for about 20k but it’s not a car you can really find at a dealership, so I would have to pretty much pay cash for it.

I have about 100k saved up in my HYSA, 20k or so in checking (is this stupid?) and another 100k or so in investments. If I did buy the car I would just pull the 20k from my HYSA.

Would it be dumb to spend that much on a car at this point in my life when I’m trying to save up for a house? I live in California so every dollar counts towards that and  I feel like it would be a more irresponsible purchase later in life when I’m married and have a family. It wouldn’t be a daily driver or a practical family car at all but I would keep my 4Runner (2016, paid off).",1728350896.0,0,17,1fyobp6

My situation is as follows:

* $23.2k total in credit card debt split up as follows: $12.5k, $4.7k, $3.2k, $1.6k, $1.2k. The 1.6k and 1.2k are 0% interest until next year.
* Only monthly payment is $560 for health insurance (I have private insurance). I will be lowering this as soon as possible. I do not pay for food or housing at this time due to my roommate being an angel.
* Everything I can possibly sell has be sold.
* I have $5k in a savings account, $2k in my checking account, $70k in my 401k from my old employer. No other assets.
* No student loans, car loans, or otherwise.

The debt is down from $80k two years ago, so it could have been much worse.  I am very aware I am in a bad situation but I have sent out over 1,000 applications without any luck. I am trying very hard, but I am running out of money and do not know how is best to proceed.

My questions are as follows:

* Would it be possible to take a loan from my 401k?
* I can make minimum payments for a while. Would it be wise to continue making the minimums while I have no income or should I pay more?

little bit of background, im a recent college grad who just moved back home after school and living in different apartments the last few years. i moved to try to save money, work full time, and build up my credit (college loans ain’t a joke). while living in different apartments through college, i obviously had bills to pay and always did so on time. in my last living situation before moving back home, i was the name holder on all utility bills that came to our apartment (gas, electric, etc) that I shared with 4 others. when I moved out, one of my former roommates said that she would reach out to the utility companies and transfer her name as being in charge of communications/payment. i’ve been home for 4 almost 5 months now and have had no issues with anything until the other day when I noticed in my email that I received a notice from a debt collector stating that I owed roughly $1,100 unpaid to Eversource for the last few months. 
upon further investigation (and talking to my former roommate) i do realize that the debt is accurate and the account in my name never got canceled. since receiving this notice i’ve been super scared and unsure what to do next. do i contact the debt collection agency and say that the debt is correct and is mine? do i reach out to eversource instead of the debt collection agency? i’m so worried about how this stupid mistake/error will affect my credit (which already isn’t super high) and am unsure how this follows me/my credit in terms of being reported. the notice states i have until mid november (next month) to respond and get things resolved and i know i will have the funds arranged by then (i have to collect the money from the girls living there now obviously) but that is not something that will happen straight away as this is unexpected for everyone living there as well and i do not have $1,100 just lying around to take care of it (not sure how they didn’t realize they weren’t paying electric and/or how it wasn’t turned off but that’s a question for another time). i am so unfamiliar with debt/debt collection and how to proceed, so any advice will help! just want to do things in the best way that will maximize any serious retributions if possible. tyia and sorry for the long/confusing post!",1728349456.0,0,1,1fynudr

No debt - paid off house and car, no student loans or any other loans. About $200K in the bank.

The issue is that I stay at home with my toddler who has special needs, lots of therapy appointments, etc. Currently she's 2, and I hope that she will be able to be in school full time when she's 5 for Kindergarten, so I have 3 years until that \*potentially\* happens. Can't guarantee full time school will be the best choice for her though, so I still don't know what the long term will look like for my ability to care for her and not have to work full time outside the home.

My co-parent makes tons of money and will be paying for 100% of her expenses, so that's another plus. I only have to cover my own expenses.

I know next to nothing about personal finance. I have the following goals:

* Make enough money passively to live off of or at least make it possible to live off a part-time income (not sure what my yearly expenses are yet without accounting for my daughter's expenses, but she definitely costs a lot more than me - will have to do budget calculations for this)
* Save for mid-term items like a new car in 10+ years, home improvements, etc.
* Fully fund my retirement account every year (can only put in $7000/year, right? seems low)
* Invest for long-term gains to supplement retirement

Is this at all realistic? I'm reading into Bogleheads and watching videos. So far, it seems like it can help with long-term planning, but not the short- and mid-term.

personalfinance,"Besides selling it, how can I leverage the land I am being gifted to help get rid of my consumer debt?","Currently about $60k in debt due to poor life choices, I'm working on it. A relative is preparing to gift me a piece of rural wooded property next to theirs.  Recently they had some logging done so it has a curb cut and a dirt driveway. Land valued at around $60k in 2023 before logging.

The property has sentimental value and is next to where they will live for the foreseeable future so I don't want to develop it in any way that would disturb them or feel disrespectful of the land and gift.  

I had thought of getting a tiny home/cabin to put on it and rent. Land is about 10 acres I think, it has a nice view and is pretty private but not too remote.  I have found some premade tiny homes ( legit ones, not home Depot sheds) for around $20k.  I have basically no disposable income and bad credit right now, it's crashed over the last 2 years after getting fired and falling into bad depression. 

Is there any chance of getting like a 100k mortgage to consolidate my debt and buy a tiny home to put on the property?  I figure a 15 year loan at 8% would be less than $1k a month which would be less than my current payments and it could be used to make money.  If I got a 20-30 year loan and or a better rate it would be even lower.

Are there any other ways I could leverage the land to help fix my situation without losing it?  And if I default on consumer debt could they come after that land once it's actually in my possession?

investing,Thinking of buying WTI Crude Oil.,"Hi, everyone! I’ve been analyzing historical oil price data and the effects of major geopolitical events, particularly those in the Middle East. I put together a chart that shows the correlation between these events and oil prices, spanning from 1946 to the present. What stood out to me is the contrast in price behavior between events involving direct U.S. interest versus those where the U.S. wasn’t as involved.

From this analysis, it’s evident that oil prices are not just about disruptions in supply but also about market perception and geopolitical risks, especially when Western powers are involved. The market tends to price in higher risk premiums when U.S. interests are directly threatened, amplifying price movements.

personalfinance,"Have all the basics covered (401ks, IRAs, cash savings). What else can we do to better prepare for (a hopefully early) retirement?","Hi all, I’m looking to get some advice on what my wife and I can do to better set ourselves up financially. By a lot of measures I think we’re doing really great but high inflation, having to self fund retirement if/when social security goes away, the ever present risk of layoffs in our industries, the fact a surprise medical event can bankrupt you in the US, potentially having to help family, high costs of kids (eventually lol), etc. have us reconsidering if what we’re doing is sufficient/optimal. As such, any and all advice is welcome. 



Anyway, onto the important details:

* We are late 20s
* HHI is mid 300s
* We live in a HCOL area
* We both max out our 401ks. We both have the money in some flavor of a target date fund. 
* We both max out traditional IRAs through vanguard (again with the money going into a vanguard target date fund). For a while we were doing Roth IRAs but we hit the income limits. I’m currently reading up on backdoor roths to see if those are a huge advantage when compared to the traditional IRA. 
* We have a high yield savings account that we contribute 2,000 per month to. This is for emergencies, vacations, bigger purchases, etc so a lot comes out of here. Any time it gets to have over 50k, we move/invest the overage to our joint brokerage account (see below)
* We have a joint brokerage account and all the money is in VTSAX. We throw bonuses, etc in here, as well as any overages from our savings (mentioned previously)
* The only debt we have are student loans, our mortgage, and a car loan. We pay credit cards off in full each month. The house is modest (even if our rate wasn’t great) and the mortgage payment + insurance is like 3600 per month. the car is new but it isn’t anything crazy (the payment is 650 per month). We expect to have it for 12+ years (we're not people that need new/flashy cars). Student loans are about 650 per month and we pay the minimum required. 
* As it stands now, we probably have about 300k in our investment accounts (it was only recently we got to such comfortable states salary-wise). 
* We will probably inherit somewhere in the 500k-million range but I don’t count that because it’s not guaranteed, I’m trying to get my parents to spend more to enjoy retirement, and most importantly, I don’t like to think about it.
* We have decent career prospects so we’ll probably have some pay increases throughout our careers
* I think we’d both like retire early, perhaps in our 50s. Although calling it “retirement” isn’t 100% accurate since we both would probably work part time doing something we actually like instead of our current corporate careers. Who knows whether we'll have golden handcuffs though...
* For retirement, we are very open to retiring abroad in a lower COL area.

personalfinance,Employer match explained,"Hello, my job is going to start offering a 3.5% employer match for employee contributions of 6% of their paycheck. I'm new to matches and understand the gist, but I have a few strategy questoins/clarifications.  

1. I max out my 401k every year, usually dumping my entire paycheck in the first half of the year so max it as soon as possible. My understanding is that the match is only per pay period, so to maximize employer dollars, I need to contribute 6% at a minimum in each of the 26 pay periods. I still want to max my 401k as soon as possible, how should I go about achieving this? I think it would be by doing the math and front loading heavy contributions the first half of the year but then only 6% for the remaining until i reach the 23,000.  

2. Does employer funds count as traditional or roth money for tax purposes? I know I'm not receiving the funds right now due to vesting, and I'm not going to see a deduction on my w2 (I suspect my employer gets benefits from contributing), but when I withdrawal, will I have a tax event? For context all my 401k money is currently roth.

personalfinance,"Parents are about 6 months behind on their mortgage. Emotional considerations aside, could helping them catch up actually make good financial sense for me?","**Parents:** mid-70s, no longer working, only income is Social Security, about $2300/mo combined. No retirement savings. Have fallen behind on their mortgage due to a mix of bad luck and poor decisions. About $91k owed on mortgage; house is currently worth about $350-400k. Monthly payment toward mortgage/taxes/insurance is about $1500.

**Me:** early 40s, about $250k in retirement and savings accounts. No credit card debt; only loan is my own mortgage. No siblings. No kids.

**Location:** New Jersey, USA.

**More Details:**

I recently found out that my parents owe about 6 months of back mortgage payments and have had trouble consistently paying their mortgage for at least the past 2 years. Since learning this, I have been helping them research their options, mainly:

* **Reverse mortgage:** Keeps them in their current home, but they will likely have trouble qualifying due to their poor payment history. I would have the option to purchase the home at 95% of market value when they pass away, but wouldn’t automatically inherit.
* **Selling their house and downsizing:** Removes the mortgage payment, but once the $91k mortgage balance and money for necessary repairs is subtracted, they probably have about $200-250k of equity to work with, which really limits the options in their area.
* **Refinancing:** They have supposedly asked their lender to reduce the monthly payment due to hardship, but have been refused. Not sure what other options, if any, they have here.

My parents and I have a good relationship overall and they are not the type to ask me for money, so any offers of help from me would not be made under pressure. Emotionally, I’d like to help them out, but I also don’t want to endanger my own financial stability by doing so.

What I’ve been thinking, though, is that I could help them catch up on the amount they currently owe, then offer to contribute a set monthly amount toward their mortgage and property taxes: probably about $500-1000 toward the $1500 monthly payment. This money would otherwise be sitting in a savings/retirement account or spent on non-essential hobbies. If I’m understanding correctly, this seems like it could actually be a good option for me financially in the long term:

* If my parents get a reverse mortgage, I could buy the house at 95% of the future market value, but otherwise wouldn’t inherit anything.

* If they downsize to a smaller house, I could inherit and sell it, but it likely wouldn’t be worth as much as their current house, even subtracting whatever’s owed on the mortgage.

* If I help out now and eventually inherit their current house, I can sell it and keep any after-tax profits…which is probably going to be roughly as good, if not better than, a typical savings or market return.

Here are the very rough calculations I made to come to this conclusion: let’s say I give my parents $10,000 now and then pay $500 per month toward their mortgage for e.g. 10 years. If I put those deposits in an index fund instead and assume a 7% return, it would be worth a bit over $102k in 10 years according to this [compound interest calculator](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator). Even if their current house’s value were to fall ~30% to $250k and there was still a mortgage of about $90k on it, it seems like inheriting and selling that house is still the better financial choice: 

* Projected 6% return of investing $10,000 now, then adding $500 monthly for 10 years: ~$102k
* Projected profit from eventual house sale at $250k, minus ~$100k for mortgage payoff and repairs = ~$150k

Am I completely off-base here? If so, what am I missing? Are there any other options and/or caveats we should consider first?

personalfinance,Retirement question and current savings ,"I am 25, with $75k of savings in a money market account. I have $30k in my 401k through work. I have ~5K in debt, in the form of in interest free medical bills I am paying monthly on. My gross income is $94k. I have been reading through the guides on r/personalfinance, and was hoping for some more personalized advice:

Regarding 401K, I currently have 15% contributions split 8% to pre tax and 7% to Roth. Based on what I've been reading, it seems I should stop contributing to the Roth 401K and instead open an IRA. Is that advisable?

Regarding savings, I currently live in an apartment. Next July when my lease is up, my thought was to put a down payment on a house. I believe a house would be a good investment, but is there something I could/should be doing with my savings in the meantime? Should I instead look at continuing to rent at that time and (saving an emergency fund) go ahead invest what I currently have saved? 

If I buy a house, saving an emergency fund, should the down payment be the remainder of the savings? Should I make a smaller down payment and invest that in something like index funds? 

If not apparent, my financial knowledge is pretty limited, I've just been told to save all my life and am trying to learn more and better situate myself for the future.

My company currently gives me a company car, and they pay for all gas/insurance/maintenance. I am allowed to use it for personal use as well, but am billed 17 cents/mile for personal use (obviously not billed when I put business miles on it). This amounts to around $50-$60 per month I have to pay to use it for non-business errands. I have a personal car as well but I rarely use it and pretty much use the work car for everything.

My company just started offering employees the opportunity to return the company car and receive a reimbursement of 67 cents/mile for all business mileage.

I at one point went through the math, and came to conclusion that paying down a 5% interest loan with extra payments is the exact same return as investing the same amount per month on an investment that returns 5%. 

He's convinced that paying down loans with extra payments is less because of it being ""simple interest, not compound.""  Do you have a good way to explain how they're the same?

personalfinance,FMLA + Short-term Disability Usage for Medical Leave,"Hello, fellow Redditors, I could use some experience- or knowledge-based advice from you all.  I will attempt to get all the information in here succinctly to get some (hopefully) sound advice, inclusive of if this question is better suited elsewhere.

BASICS: Wife (42) and I (42) are located and employed  in WA, USA.  My wife was very recently diagnosed with breast cancer, so this is the first time either of us has encountered a scenario in which we would need to tap into our existing short-term disability (STD) and to file for FMLA (noting she does carry long-term disability also).  As her treatment plan is forming (generally it will be chemo -> surgery -> radiation), it is going to be really spread out the calendar in addition to the question-mark of what level of symptoms she will experience.  Her physician team will support her in paperwork submission or modifications throughout.

COVERAGE: STD - 75% of salary for 25 weeks, appears to be a small waiting period (\~ 1 week)

GENERIC QUESTIONS:  G1: To me it seems that STD and FMLA serve different purposes, but can you confirm that we would file for both?  ||  G2: Given the unpredictable nature of the treatment symptoms, do you recommend just taking a chunk of time (noting that the whole treatment will be more like 9 months long), or swooping in and out as needed?  Are there any implications for doing the latter from an insurance perspective? ||  G3: Since the full treatment exceeds the 25-weeks of STD, any considerations toward positioning for LTD?  

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:  S1: How should I expect that the time will be tracked, would she theoretically submit for any time off as FMLA, even when receiving STD?  ||  S2: Any mistakes you made in your own experience that I could learn from?

We are early in the process, but figured I could lean on you all to help course correct here in the early bits so that I can, at least, have a better idea of the questions I/we should be asking or considering... not that I am wary of HR and insurance, I promise!

We both grew up somewhat poor with very strict parents so neither of us never went out much, so my plan was to take her on her dream vacation( very stupid I know), so I saved for months and months and finally booked the trip without telling her or anyone. Once we got there everything was a lot more expensive that I expected it to be, but she was having a lot of fun and was really happy so I didn't want to ruin it for her by complaining or telling her to take the cheapest options everytime we went out. Sadly I ended up around 250 euros over my budget, normally it wouldn't have been a big deal because i could have taken it out of my scholarship, however I won't be getting for some reasons i wont be getting it before next month. So now I find myself with less that 20 euros in my bank account and no cash for the rest of the month, and i have to pay 47 à week for the train, if I dont I cannot go to school.

(But don’t worry, owning a 100 year old home is charming, which makes it all worth it, right? …right?) We didn’t have the savings in cash to pay for it without dipping into the e-fund or taking out a loan.

It’s not a done deal yet from what I can tell, but it still has me thinking. Our e-fund is pretty low. It would only give me a month if our spending is lean.

personalfinance,Another Whole Life Post,"(Throwaway acct for privacy)

Hi everyone. I know Whole Life gets brought up a lot here, and that the answer is almost universally ‘get term instead and invest the difference.’ But I wanted to ask a bit in regards to my specific situation.  
  
My father is 100% sold on Whole Life being a wonderful investment vehicle for retirement. Back in 2007 he set up a policy for me, and in 2018 he set up a second smaller policy for me, both with Northwestern Mutual. He is still the ‘owner’ on both but wants to transfer the payments and ownership over to me. He has a high income, so Whole Life may make sense for him since he has long since maxed out other retirement savings like 401k (but doesn't seem to understand that it isn't necessarily the best solution for everyone).  
  
Policy 1 (since 2007):  
Annual Premium: $2173.56  
Net Cash Value: $40,469.29  
Death Benefit: $330,101.00  
  
Policy 2 (since 2018):  
Annual premium: $1116.24  
Net Cash Value: $4,549.10  
Death Benefit: $106,750.00  
  
I know that typically whole life is not a great choice for a few reasons, one of which being the first 5-15 years before you ‘break even.’ But given that the first 17 years of policy A have been paid for - it seems to become a little more beneficial. Ran the numbers quickly and got an overall rate of return (from start->now) of 1% on the 2007 policy and -11% on the 2018 policy (makes sense given that it is newer and not past the breakeven).  
  
I spoke with the agent for a while to try to get some clarity, as I don’t understand all this that well. Trying to cross-check his info with what I can read online since he obviously has a vested interest in me keeping the policies. I asked him how much of the annual premium was the ‘insurance’ portion and he told me approximately $350. He also said that the annual dividend is around 5%. He gave us a sheet of guaranteed / forecasted accumulated cash value of the combined policies. In 40 years the estimate was $273k guaranteed / $600k forecasted, which when plugged into excel gave me 2% / 4% overall rate of return respectively. Doesn’t seem like a fantastic return on investment compared to more tax advantaged accounts / just investing in some index funds. He says that we could take a loan out against the policy to pay off our higher interest debt, and that since the interest is approximately equal to the dividends the money is getting in the policy it is effectively a 0.5% rate. He also claims we’ll see tax advantages because in retirement we can ‘choose’ our tax bracket by deciding how much we want to take out of different accounts, and that whole life gives us another stream of income to use in retirement.  
  
Bit of context on my wife and I. I am 28M, healthy, making about $130k/yr. 10% towards 401k with 5% employer match. She is 26F, also healthy, making \~$115k/yr. Also 10% towards 401k with 7% employer match. We each have ‘free’ life insurance through our employers at 2x salary. No dependents yet (but kids are likely within a few years). Debt wise we have a mortgage (\~4%), 2 small car loans ($2.5k@2.5% and $6.5k@7%), and my wife has $160k in student loan debt (rates on those range from 4.8-6.8%, with the 6.8% loan being $13k).  
  
My intuition here is that we would be better off purchasing term, cashing out the policies, and focusing on upping our 401k contributions, trying to max out up to the $23k per individual limit. As for the cash out using some of it to pay off our high interest debt (the $6.5k car loan and $13k high rate student loan) - and investing the rest. I would also try to work on paying off her loans a bit more aggressively since we’re making minimum payments on extended standard repayment and the total interest we would pay over the whole period is … a lot.  
  
Am I missing anything here? Does it make any sense at all to hold on to the 2007 policy as an additional emergency fund / savings since we seem to have passed the ‘breakeven’ point with it? I want to be sure I'm not tossing aside something that could be very beneficial just because Whole Life is 'usually' bad.",1728495912.0,1,2,1fzxepp

personalfinance,Need advice on what to do next. (Severe car loan debt),"
Hello all! 
Ive found myself in a bit of a predicament. 
Im looking for any advice on how I can move FORWARD. Ive accepted and learned from my mistakes. 

Brief back story; 

I started a business in 2019-2020 
Made my way to ≈ $60,000 in cash and crypto and some other investments by 2021. Money was flowing and wasn’t an issue. I was young and dumb and spent a bunch on airbnbs, clothes, food, and entertainment. 

I made the dreaded young person mistake when they first touch some real money to finance a 2016 BMW M3 (my dream car) (clearly out of my budget). The numbers are as follows;

Total Cash Price : $58,770
With taxes and fees : $65,198
Down payment : $2,500 (i know…)
Amount Financed : $62,698 
Finance charge : $12,278.48 (5.99% APR)
Total Payments : $74,976.48
Total Sale Price : $77,476.48 
Monthly Payment ≈ $980 

I drove the car before I bought it, loved it and nothing seemed abnormal. 
Within 48 hours of purchase, the check engine light came on and the car went into limp mode. Turns out it was a bunch of airflow issues. I replaced the sensors and cleared codes and the issues persisted. I was sick of it. This was wrong on the dealership. My thoughts are they cleared the codes and sold it as it was. Or even the previous owner. Car was missing 20+ bolts underneath as well. Previous owner definitely modified it to some extent. 

I drove it for 4 months dealing with the issues and spending a couple thousand fixing them as they came.

I was on a cruise with a whole group of similar cars one day and boom it happened again. Had to pull over in the mountains and watch every car pass me. Right then and there I said fuck this and started thinking about getting rid of the car again. 

This was in 2021-2022. 
I emailed back and forth with the dealership and the final deal was to give me $53,000 for the car and trade it for a 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range. The details of the deal are as follows; 

BMW loan balance : $60,700
BMW Traded credit : $53,000 
Rollover before tax : $7,700
Rollover after tax : $8,870.68
(paid 4k down so only 3.7k was taxed)

TESLA TRADE INFO: 
Total Cash Price : $59,980
With taxes and fees : $73,777.69
Down payment : $4,000
Amount Financed : $73,777.69
Finance charge : $16,949.03 (5.99% APR)
Total Payments : $90,726 (I know I know) 
Monthly Payment ≈ $1,080 

SO… as you can see, im majorly f***** 
This is not only because of my bad decisions but because of Tesla depreciation being MF OVER 45%!!! 

Tesla Payoff : $52,000
KBB value of Tesla : $24,961 
Remainder ≈ $27,038.50 

Paid so far towards this loan : 
$30,511 ($9.2k interest)

Im unsure what to do next. 
My income has changed severely. Im living damn near paycheck to paycheck at this point. Im taking care of family members and need to know what my best options would be.

personalfinance,New Insurance Plan Help - HDHP Access 2000 (with HSA) VS Access Plus 500 for Year of having a baby (With Cigna),"Hey you incredible Personal Finance people!  
  
Looking for feedback on Which plan to go with for myself and my spouse. For reference I think the High Deductible Plan may suit us best since we're choosing our plan starting in November and for next year. But would like another opinion.

for context. The high deductible plan looks like it will allow us to easily hit our dectible with my wife going into labor at the start of the year. And myself having a surgery as well that will cost a good bit.

The only thing to keep in mind is I hit my individual Deductible and OOP max on a Access Plus 500 plan that was 500 Deductible, $5000 OOP. So I am unsure on how the carry over would go into effect.

As you can also see below the difference in the breakdown. The HDHP would cost me $2,460 LESS yearly in the premium. And with my wife giving birth, and myself having a big surgery, I don't see how the $1500 higher deductible would be worth it? I will put a breakdown as well

Price Breakdown:

**Open Access 2000 Deductible HSA HDHP Plan (Cigna):**

**Monthly premium:** $218 (yearly cost $2,616)  
**Cop pays:** - (10% after deductible hit)  
**Coinsurance: 1**0% (they cover 90% after deductible hit)  
**Deductible** $2,000 / $4,000 for family  
**OOP Max:** $5,000/$10,000 for family

**HSA Eligible - Which I will probably max out $8000**

*deductible $2,000 (hit)*  
*Copayments $0*  
*Coinsurance $1,100*

**Cop pays:** $15  
**Coinsurance:** 20% (they cover 80% after deductible hit)

personalfinance,Should I prioritize paying 401k loan or putting more in retirement?,"Posting for my dad, but I will be typing it like I am him so there's no confusion:

50M, 64k income

I took out a 401k loan to pay an IRA fee and my daughters car repair (much to my sons dismay) of $12,500

At the time I had put 10% in my 401k and I opened up a Roth IRA last year and have $3k in it so far but trying to add what I can a week

Have a family of 6 

I am low on retirement funds, I have about $112k total in retirement not including the 401k loan 

Should I prioritize paying off the 401k loan which is $12,500 and 9.5% interest, which I've paid about $600 off so far at $60 a week which gets taken out of my paycheck

Now my son has me putting 13% in my 401k with a 3% match which is what I can afford and with some side jobs I try to put in $25-$50 a week into Roth IRA because he said I have to catch up especially if I want to retire by 63 due to body falling apart

Basically, should I prioritize paying off 401k loan as soon as possible or should I just continue trying to put as much of funds into retirement as I can and pay off loan as I go 

My truck is paid off next month, and then I need to do about $2k of rust repair. My gf (44) has seperate finances, but is terrible with money. She has a boat, car, and multiple other monthly payments 

After December I'll have no monthly obligations and want to either pay off 401k loan faster or put another few % in retirement or Roth ir

personalfinance,Getting some inheritance and not sure how to proceed,"My wife and I recently had someone we considered family, but who wasn't family by blood, pass away. That's a whole other thing. However, we were surprised to find out that we're going to be getting a portion of the estate, once everything sells. We weren't ready for that and everything has sold fairly quickly. At the moment, it appears that we are going to be getting around $50,000. We've never had anywhere close to that amount of money, so I have no idea what's involved, what taxes I'm going to have to pay, etc. 

I've looked through this subreddit, but haven't found anything pertinent to my situation, although I'm sure I could if I continued to dig. I'm sorry if this has been asked before, but I don't have a ton of time to delve into digging through to figure this out. I work a full-time job, my wife is a stay-at-home mom taking care of our kids, and we both volunteer as soccer coaches and are coaching 4 different kids' soccer teams, as well as volunteer teaching Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to underprivileged kids, so our schedule is hectic to the say the least. There's more we're involved in, but I don't want to bore you with that.

Anyway, our current financial situation: 

* $136k left on our mortgage
* $7k in credit card debt
* $8k in a savings account
* $5k in a 401k
* $1,500 in a Roth IRA

We're kind of making ends meet currently, but it isn't easy, and we've had to pull a little bit of savings out recently. I'm just not sure about what steps are going to follow, what taxes I need to pay, and what I should pay down, if anything.

personalfinance,Reverse mortgage and hurricane,"Hi,
My parents have a reverse mortgage on their house. They are right in the path of Hurricane Milton, and although their house is not on the beach or expected to flood, there’s a good chance they’ll lose their roof and a possibility that one of their big trees will fall on the house. 

They’ve evacuated out of state with me, but dad has dementia and mom doesn’t understand finance or the terms of the RM and I don’t have the paperwork here. 

What happens if the house is severely damaged in regards to the RM? They have home insurance but not flood insurance. Her plan, if the house is damaged, is to take out more money from the RM to pay for any repairs not covered. But what happens with the RM if the house is a wreck? All I remember from when I read the RM paperwork years ago was that the house needs to be in good condition for the bank once my parents die or move out. 

I obviously hope my parents don’t lose their house in the storm, but cynically I hope a sink hole opens under it and swallows the entire property so those reverse mortgage vultures get nothing. ",1728493312.0,1,0,1fzwder

Repayments are just under $400 a month for 7 years at 10.99% which I believe ends up being something like $33,000

My income on average is probably about $2000 a month which means I make more than enough at the moment, problem is that sometimes that drops due to reasons like less money coming in (I work in a family business where income comes from orders and if less orders come I get less work)

I don’t doubt that I can’t pay it off but I’m just seeking advice on how I should manage my money and if it’s worth it to go for the new car or to save for the next year or two to get something outright.

I've tried crunching numbers and feeling a little stumped when comparing them. Currently pregnant with twins, which is considered high risk. I expect to deliver in December or January. It's common for twins to need NICU time, but not always. So lots of things with my delivery and their care/needs that we can't really predict.

My husband and I are currently enrolled in the POS plan. The chart below includes details for enrolling in the family plan for all 4 of us. 

We are also currently in the process of closing on our first home this month. With that and welcoming the twins and knowing we'll have many more expenses, I worry about having a bigger chunk of money taken out of my checks each month (say if we went with the HDHP and contributed the max to the HSA). My husband runs his own business so his income is variable. It's never been an issue and has always shown stability and growth, but my income is the only guaranteed in our family. I want to make sure we're making the smartest financial decision possible for our family. Thankfully after buying our home, we will retain a healthy savings and emergency fund, so good there. I know there is more to consider, but when I look just at the max spend the HDHP is $904 cheaper. 

I do know that I can change our medical plan again with the twins birth/qualifying life event, but because I am on the edge of delivering in '24 vs '25 and I expect to be very exhausted then, I'd like to make this decision now during open enrollment. 

Given my pregnancy and possible delivery in Dec/Jan and having twins, which plan makes the most sense for us? Is there something else that we should be considering that I haven't mentioned here? (medically or financially)

I shouldn’t have been hospitalized, I was not a danger to myself or others and the claim that I couldn’t care for myself was unfair but that is what it is now. I’m stuck with large bills for the two ambulance rides (and over 2.5k in copays and coinsurance for the ER and hospital stay + probably more that is still processing).  Currently looking at about 7.5k. I am applying for financial assistance from the facility bill but cannot apply for aid from the individual providers but can do payment plans. My insurance told me to send them a picture of the ambulance bills I received and I have done this but have not heard anything back. 

I am a student. I work part-time but have been on leave for 2 months since this situation happened. I have about $1k in my checking account and 5k in my savings account. My monthly expenses are about 1.5k with loans and housing+ bills. I have been physically sick over these bills. The anxiety is worse than it was and after my last experience I am afraid to ask for help. When I was working my gross pay was a few dollars (less than $10) above the Medicaid cut off. I am currently getting short term disability and using my PTO—about $1100 a month. I return to work in a few days. I asked my school for help and they offered me a loan that I cannot afford and has to be paid back within one term. The anxiety is debilitating and I’ve been unable to leave my home since getting the bills. What do I do? What kind of language do people use to negotiate? Is there a template somewhere?

personalfinance,To consolidate debt or not?,"Hey everyone just looking for a little advice here. My wife and I are trying to figure out the best way to go about this. We’ve got roughly $15,000 debt from CCs and I’ve been thinking more and more that the best route to go would be getting a fixed rate loan but I’m not sure what companies are best for this or even IF this is the best route.

We’ve got our spending under control, pretty much living way below our means at this point to try and save when we can and only spending on necessities. We’ve both agreed that if we do go the fixed rate loan route we’re going to freeze the CCs we do have and only unfreeze them in the event of a major emergency. My only concern is my credit score won’t be high enough to get a decent APR on a loan. It’s sitting at a 633. 

One other good thing I’ve accounted for is I’m not at full rate pay with my new job yet (it’s a 2 year apprenticeship) so eventually I’ll be able to put a lot more money down when I do hit full rate.

personalfinance,Which debt should I prioritize,"WWYD? In March I expect a CD to mature and a bonus, and will have $30k in cash and I’m trying to figure out the best way to use it. Here are my options. 
1. I recently borrowed $30k from my 401k to buy a house, and by March I will owe $29,500 on that loan. That is a 9.5% interest rate, but it’s going to myself. I could pay this off and have not much remaining for savings, but it frees up $300/month. Note that my plan only allows me to pay the entire loan off in full, no partial payments toward principal are allowed. This is a 15 year loan, so I will have paid it off 14 years and 6 months early. 
2. I have an outstanding (not forgivable) student loan which will have a balance of about $20,500 by March. The interest rate is 3.35%. I’m sick of paying this freaking loan, I graduated 15 years ago! I have SEVERAL YEARS left of this loan. I will pay it off just in time for my kid to graduate high school. This option would free up $290/month in my budget and would leave me with about $9k toward savings. 
3. My spouse bought a car this year. The interest rate on the car is 6.99% and by March will have 5 years left on the loan. We had planned to refinance this to a lower rate/shorter term, but I’m tempted now to just pay it off. This would be a $24,500 payment with about $5k left over for savings. It would free up $470 a month.

personalfinance,Releasing funds/selling shares from Delaware Funds (Macquarie),"First up, I'll admit to feeling fairly financially illiterate in asking this but here we go:

This is in regards to a USA investment for a UK resident (dual nationality but never lived in the States).

I have shares in the Delaware Ivy Large Cap Growth Fund Class A. It was invested a long time ago (Waddell and Reed at the time) and apart from once, about 20+ years ago, it has never been touched. Back then I had to write a letter requesting a part of the fund be sold and they posted the resulting funds to me. It was never that big and even after all this time it's still under $10K.

My questions are: 

-Having recently decided I'd like to make use of the remaining money, I've successfully registered for online access\* but am at a bit of a loss as to how add a bank account or otherwise request a cheque/check to be cut for part or all of the funds. Some functions, like ""trade"" are sort of greyed out. Perhaps because I'm using a VPN, perhaps because there's some other steps I've yet to complete (see ""add a bank account"" above). Can someone explain whether these are things I should be able to do fully online or will I have to go through a lengthy phone and snail-mail process again?

-Is it better to sell incrementally (I don't necessarily want to redeem it all at once), or as a whole?

-Having never lived, or earned (apart from this fund) in the US, I've also never paid taxes or even registered. Will this be another bit of bureaucracy I'm facing or is the sum involved small enough that that wouldn't be a concern? Or is this going to entirely bite me in the ass?

Again, I feel like these are some fundamentally basic questions but it's a whole financial arena that I've basically never really interfaced with, to the extent that I considered posting in ELI5 but obviously decided this was a better forum to ask.

Any helpful answers or useful nudges much appreciated, as a relatively recent first-time home/flat owner, I'd like to make the most of this money finally and invest it in renovations and of course the mortgage.

Savings:

$140k liquid at 4.5% interest

Retirement: $40k for me, my wife is on a pension

I have a $11k car loan at 3.99% percent and a student loan of $9k at 3%.

I am wanting to have 160k saved liquid with zero debt in around 14 months which will be pretty easy to do. 

So then I have a 90k down payment with closing costs for a 460-480k home. We could buy it now but I want to wait another year and wipe out the debt.

personalfinance,Seeking Advice on Car Purchase - balancing Budget with reliability ,"Hi everyone! Due to an accident, I need a vehicle, and I’d appreciate advice on balancing affordability with safety and reliability. I also don’t drive a lot (gym, errands, office on occasion) and work from home most days. Here’s my situation and the cars I’m considering:

My Preferences:
* Models in Consideration: Honda CR-V (2023+), Honda Accord (2015+), Toyota Camry (2015+), RAV4 (2019+), Mazda CX-5 (2015+) or CX-50, Mazda 6, and Acura/Lexus 2-row SUVs.
* Features: preference for blind-spot monitoring, Apple CarPlay, and ideally low to moderate mileage.
* Financing: My credit union offers savings on financing for 2023. I also seen some APR incentives on new cars
* if a car note is a factor, less than or equal to 500 per month 

Budget and Financials:
* Net Income: $5,000/month 
* Monthly Expenses: $1,500 for bills and around $2,100 for variable costs (groceries, hobbies, etc.).
* Savings: $60K, with $1,400 monthly contributions, plus around $140K in retirement accounts
* Goals: Potentially invest in a business, invest in real estate, or pursue an MBA in the next 3 years. And continue to invest in hobbies. 

Options I'm Considering:
1. New SUV or Sedan: Starting around $29,735, but dealer markups (2-3k more) can make this pricier. Financing would require monthly payments and I would hate a high car note 

2. New-ish or Certified Pre-Owned (CPO): Cars in good condition with low miles around $25,000–$35,000, balancing cost with warranty and reliability. 

3. Older Used Accord, Camry, Mazda CX-5 (2015–2018): Recently saw options like a 2016 Honda Accord with 140k miles for $10K ($13K out the door) and a 2018 Mazda CX-5 with 80k miles for $17K. I could pay these outright if below 15k out the door but would need to budget for potential repairs given the mileage.

I had a brief consult with a financial adviser recently and one thing he mentioned was considering splitting contributions between a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k). I’m fortunate enough to be in a high tax bracket and so it didn’t make sense to me why I’d want to do this. Currently I max out my traditional 401(k) and also max out a backdoor Roth IRA, so I am taking some advantage of tax-free withdrawal options. My company also only matches on traditional 401(k), so it would be completely stupid to forgo matching money, although it is possible to contribute up to the max company match and then switch over to the Roth until I max my total personal contribution.

So…is there something I’m missing here as to why it would be worthwhile to consider putting some money into the Roth 401(k) rather than sock it all away into the traditional?",1728482802.0,1,9,1fzs8r3

As a UK resident with a US passport, I have recently discovered some issues relating to what I can invest in.

The main issue I’m facing is that I currently invest in a global tracker fund through Vanguard. I’m aware that this will lead to issues  in future as it is classified as a PFIC which is taxed harshly by the US.

I’m looking for a solution to reinvest my money. The ideal outcome for me would be able to invest in a global tracker fund through an ISA. There are a couple solutions that I am aware:

1. Invest directly in the stocks. I believe this is called direct indexing. I’m reluctant to do this as I don’t think I will get the same diversification and imagine admin will be a pain. It would be good to hear if anyone has had success using this approach.

2. Invest in US domiciled funds with HMRC compliant reporting. This is definitely my preferred option but appears to be very challenging to do. It seems to be very difficult to invest in US based funds from the UK for legislative reasons. One workaround for this is to qualify as a professional investor but I don’t think I will. Does anyone have any workarounds for this that would allow me to invest in a US domiciled fund from the UK. I would love to be able to purchase these through an ISA.

My mother made me sign as guarantor though, claiming that since I am now an adult, it's not allowed for anyone other than me to be the guarantor. I'm pretty skeptical of that claim, but that's partly why I'm here now.

Long story short, my parents have dropped the ball on me. They have ignored the medical bills month after month, without letting me know that they might not be able to pay. And just to clarify, it's not that they're too broke to pay for it. There's been multiple opportunities where they could've and should've paid it off and didn't. Whether they can pay it off at this current moment is beyond me. They just bought a new house, haven't sold the old one, and are telling me they'll pay it off whenever they sell the old house.

personalfinance,Looking for online bank / investing platform with the most options,"So my dad is in his 70's, is single, and he has mild non alziemers dementia that makes numbers and remembering to do things on his own difficult.  Fortunately he always knows where he is, and is not a risk to wander off.  He is also very appreciative of all the help he is getting, as we use home health aids, nurses, and family members to enable him to live in his own senior apartment rather than a nursing home.

He is 100% disabled through the VA, as most of his medical ailments, including the diabetes that likely caused the dementia is linked to agent orange exposures from Vietnam.  Because of this, his healthcare is 100% covered, and when the time comes his nursing home will be 100% covered.  He has no reason to ever go on medicaid.  His disability payments plus his social security is more than his bills by a couple thousand a month.  And he has some money saved, about 170k as of right now, as he has always been frugal and he just doesn't want to spend his money on anything and he doesn't want to travel anywhere.

So, after discussions with him, his attorney that drew up the power of attorney documents for me and my sister, and talking things over with my sister, I want to move the bulk of his money from a regular bank that doesn't offer any stock ETF funds or savings interest, to one that offers lots of options.  There are ETF's out there that are bonds, and other safe investment based.  WE want some CD's in that portfolio.  I am not asking for advice on how to build the portfolio though.  I am asking for advice on a single platform that offers all kinds of ways to invest.

Personally, I use am mix of services for my personal finances, because I don't mind having my wife and I's money sort of all over to get what I feel is the best service for each type of savings/investment.  But with my dad, needing to make it easy for him and my sister to see where his money is, as well as making it easy to setup beneficiaries so we skip probate when he passes, having everything in one place seems most sensible.

1) Should I be maxing my 401k before doing anything with a taxable broker even if I plan to use this taxable broker as a ""semi-longer term"" savings account (purchases in 3-5 years)?
2) If I plan to make large purchases in the near future (assume 20-30k purchase within 2-3 years), is it best to keep money in a HSYA or in my taxable broker? I assume this is more of a risk question than anything but I wanted to make sure I wasnt missing something.",1728474962.0,1,6,1fzpmak

personalfinance,I feel very anxious buying new clothes and other stuff,"Hi all,

I (22M) am, like I already mentioned in the title, very anxious while spending (well, trying to spend...) money.

My income lays around $1800 a month, working part-time in a restaurant and going to law school (while also working hard on my science and math skills, since I want to enroll in medical school).

Besides my expenses for school, I do eat very clean and spend a fair amount of money on healthy foods.

Well, I don't care about spending money on healthy food and my education, but the real trouble is; I do care a lot about spending money on other stuff.

It got to a point where I really need a new jacket, a new pair of shoes and some trousers, but every time I got some nice clothes into my online shopping card, I look at the total amount of around $350 (which honestly isn't a lot for a great jacket, a new pair of shoes and some trousers), and instead of paying, I get really anxious and turn my laptop off.

On the other hand, like I already mentioned, I do not feel anxious spending money on things like education, healthy food and I even invest a lot of money too. It's probably because I feel like spending money on these things will actually improve my life, whereas spending money on things like clothes or takeaway will just not improve (the quality of) my life at all.

I really want to just be able to enjoy spending money every now and then on things that will not necessarily improve the quality of my life, like buying that new pair of shoes. But the idea of consuming without a 'ROI' really makes me anxious.

Yeah I understand, it's still a lot better than just mindlessly spending money on stuff you don't even need. But still, I want to be able to spend money without the absolute regret after ever spending money.

So, for you people who also can get anxious while spending money on consumer goods; how do you deal with it?

FYI: I live in Europe, so the '$1800' a month is calculated to dollars. It's a very high income for a student my age, debt free and living at home, so being anxious while spending isn't because my income is low.",1728471234.0,0,2,1fzolg4

the most logical approach to me is to pay off the parent plus loan by living at home for another couple months to free up that $500/mo so my plan is to move out sometime December this year or January next (dying to by on my own though)


i absolutely do not want roommates so please don't offer that advice. the only other thing thats tying me down is the fact that i have a tesla and need to be in a building that has a charger but only the ""newer"" buildings have that infrastructure, and because of that im not finding studios for anything less that ~1.8k/mo.


my plan is to cap my CC spending at $500 dollars/mo which i have been able to do for the past couple months and am confident i can do it when im on my own. i track all my spending as well as groceries (i pay my parents for when they get stuff for me so im pretty sure i can do it on my own).

fwiw, im not selling my car. i grew up driving beaten ass hondas and toyotas, fixiging them up with my dad. not going back to that. the charging stats on the car last i ran the numbers was $130 to charge at home over a 3 month period. at some point, if the car lasts me until it gives out, it will save me money in the end imo.

personalfinance, 25 years old- should my girlfriend and I buy a house with all of our savings or should we rent and put our savings in the market? ,"A little context: my girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 years now. Our combined income is about $215k a year. She has about $90k in a savings account and a ton in 401k(not sure exact amount). I have $50k in savings, $20k in the market ($VOO), and about $25k in 401k. So combined we have about $160k of liquid funds for a potential house and a lot in 401k(prob not worth mentioning but thought I’d throw it out there as it is our full financial situation). I also plan to propose within the next 2 years so I will need to afford a ring/wedding.

I’m in between 3 options:

Option 1: put about $120k-$140k as a down payment on a $600k-700k home we really like and can start our lives/family in. Hope the value of our home goes up over the years while we start our savings accounts over and try to slowly build it back up.

Option 2: Buy a similar price home as in option 1 but have it be a multi family home where we charge renters most of the mortgage payment. We live in half of the house and probably won’t enjoy it as much, but can save at a much better rate with hopes of buying a nicer home in future.

Option 3: Rent a 1 bedroom apartment near our workplaces for around 3-5years and put the $160k we have saved into the market (an ETF that tracks the S&P like $VOO) as we continue to save up at a high rate. We can hope for an average of 8% return and make some solid cash for a future home. Ofcourse if the market has bad years we will have to rent for longer and wait it out.

Hi Reddit,

I’m going through a tough financial situation and would really appreciate any advice or guidance. My monthly salary is ₹57,400 and over the past few months, I’ve lost money in both the stock market and tennis betting. To make matters worse, I’ve been withdrawing from my investment account to repay debts and cover gambling losses, which has only worsened my financial state.

Adding to this, I’ve been dealing with some health issues that are making it even harder to stay focused and manage my situation. I have diabetes and ankylosing spondylitis, and these conditions often leave me feeling fatigued and overwhelmed, which only adds to my stress. I’ve also struggled with weight gain, and I’m finding it hard to keep up with both my financial responsibilities and health concerns at the same time.

Here’s a quick breakdown of my debt:

Loan 1: ₹66,051 at 27.99% interest

Loan 2: ₹1,96,430 at 19.99% interest

Loan 3: ₹1,12,000 at 15.99% interest

Loan 4: ₹18,038 at 15.99% interest

Loan 5 (Gold Loan): ₹4,25,000 at 9% interest

Loan 6: ₹26,670 at 9.75% interest


I’ve been making minimum payments, but the high interest rates and my financial losses have made it nearly impossible to get ahead. I’m trying to turn things around and would greatly appreciate any advice on:

Managing high-interest debt more effectively

Strategies to increase income or create new revenue streams

Ways to improve my health and reduce the impact it has on my financial situation


I’ve already cut down on unnecessary expenses, but it feels like I’m running out of options. Any support, advice, or tips would mean a lot to me right now. Thank you for reading and offering any help you can.

personalfinance,Need budgeting/financial advice; solo mom living paycheck to paycheck and want to change my bad habits and tackle my debt.,"EDITED TO ADD: I SPENT FOREVER WRITING THIS…. PLEASE READ IT 😩😢😩😢

Hello! I'm terrible with money. Like the worst of the worst. I am a 31 year old solo parent who is VERY lucky to have been given a paid off home by my grandpa. I need advice.. I have been working on this for 3 nights now lol. I’ll provide a general overview of my monthly expenses, my income and my (horrible) spending habits.. my goal is to get advice, tips, recommendations for what steps I should take to be financially responsible and stable from here on-starting with a budget for an inconsistent income. 

📍Info on expenses:

I have a relatively small amount of credit card debt (~$1000;$26 min payment, always pay at least $50/month), medical debt (~4000;$168/month & $188/month), student loans (~35000; currently deferring this payment), monthly car payment ($400), monthly car insurance (almost $400, totaled my car in December of 2022 with a suspended license, had no clue it was suspended due to an unpaid ticket I swore I paid-l'm an idiot, I know), monthly electric bills have been almost $350/month the last 4 months.i do have some subscriptions and spend a crazy amount on groceries, we eat at home every night during the week and eat out often on weekends.. I pack my daughter’s lunch.

CC debt: $1000 total;$50/mo

Medical debt: $4000 total;$360/mo

Car: $18500 owed; $400/mo

Car insurance: $400/mo

Electric: $350/mo

Groceries: $400 at the very least/mo

Paper towels, dishwasher tabs, laundry detergent & toilet paper: SWEAR $100/mo

📍Income: 

24’ income: $45,000/year 

I made around $54,000/year post taxes last year, but due to some changes to the job payouts this year+ had to take FMLA for 2 consecutive carpal tunnel surgeries.. I am set to make a little over $45,000. I have no savings and I am out of money by the time I get paid, biweekly.

I want to set a better example for my daughter, who just started kindergarten, on how to manage finances-basically not be like me. I'm impulsive. I get my dopamine rush from dollar store trips for crap I don't need and Amazon orders. I know I need to change and want to.
I think the first step is an honest budget. About a month ago I downloaded an app and spent all night putting in my monthly expenses etc. but it was so difficult for me to use properly because my monthly income is so inconsistent.. I work in sales and we get our bonus checks based off the prior months quota achievements the second check of the month. I'm not the absolute best at my job, but I tend to make payout pretty consistently. Any tips for budgeting or helpful tips for managing my funds in my situation?? I'm not a stupid person, but I am very undisciplined and need a simple way to jumpstart my financial fresh start.

📍Income example:

In September I brought home $3900 total post tax, in August I brought home $2700 total. 

I’m embarrassed of myself but the only thing I can do is change. 

I would love to be held accountable by someone like a financial advisor for my kind of situation but don’t have the money to fork out for one.. any recommendations? 

If you read all this and take the time to reply THANK YOU! I’m looking for any and all tips that are a little personalized for me.. I know it is money in, money out. I am working on my discipline and am in therapy (until Jan 1st because my deductible starts over and I have met it this year 🤦🏽‍♀️, thank you carpal tunnel) working through my impulsive behavior..

Side note: I have paid almost 10k in taxes this year and almost 9k for healthcare benefits for my daughter and I. I don’t have the most expensive benefit plan.. just insane to me!",1728383114.0,1,1,1fywhkv

personalfinance,Am I going to need a tax accountant?,"So my grandmother has sold her house and is moving in with me since her health is declining. She was apparently in a reverse mortgage and owed quite a bit, in the end she is only getting about 150k after paying off what she owed.  
She was in California, and shes coming to Arizona. Retired, only social security for income (less than 1800 a month) and no other assets or savings. That was not covering things in Cali very well, but it goes a lot further out here where I am, so she should be financially stable from now on.

I put her name on my house so that in the event I were to pass away it would default to her and my life insurance policy would pay it off and leave her with enough to live comfortably on.

We plan to use the funds she got from the sale to build her an ADU or multi room addition with a disability access bathroom and such on the back of my home and furnish it.

So my questions are, since I have her name on my house now, will this ADU/addition/whatever still count as reinvesting in the new home in the same way it would if I were to sell a house and immediately buy/remodel a new one? 

If she has much leftover, (the estimates Im getting for a 1 bedroom ADU or a 3 room addition are like 85-105k) would that be taxable? And if so, would putting it into the house mortgage stop it from being so?

Does her retired status change anything? 

Does leaving California have any impact on this since it's under the amount (I think it said 400k) that California is apparently applying as exit tax now?

Does anyone know about how much she would have to pay in taxes in total?

Do you think a regular tax person would be fine to handle this or should I be looking into hiring her a consult with a property tax specialist? Note that she hasn't needed to pay taxes in the 15-ish years since she retired.

I appreciate any advice here as I've never dealt with any of this, my own first and only home was just bought last year under that USDA program that got me a good rate in a rural agricultural zone, and prior to this I've always been a renter, or lived in a mobile home. So the complications of selling a home or dealing with assets above and beyond the level of a vehicle are out of my experience entirely and I'm not even certain where to start looking for these answers as the results from google include a LOT of advice that sounds contradictory, or deals with million+ dollar properties, and I'm struggling to find consistent answers for us just above the poverty line type folks that isn't bankruptcy related.",1728443766.0,1,1,1fzi5my

-------------------------------------------------------------
For context: 18F. About to be a first year international student in Australia. Parents will pay for university tuition, rent, utilities, groceries and any other shopping I may do. From what I understand, I'll get about exactly how much I need so I'm not sure how I can save much or have an emergency fund if the latter is something I even need as of now considering I don't have much or any financial pressure at the moment. I've brought up getting myself a job once I'm there but, prior all that, they much prefer that I handle my studies well and familiarise with the local situation. Which, understandable.

But, once I progress into Year 2 or 3, I'm definitely thinking to get my own income. Either through working (under the law of 48-hours for every fortnight according to the law of my visa) or stock investment (though, this would be much more of a long term income stream and the money they give me to do this is still learning money, as in if it doesn't work out, I take it as a lesson and derive better methods or strategies to investing but, if it does work out, then great, more money).",1728465055.0,1,1,1fzn5ou

If that IRA is traditional, then not all of that money is mine, because I need to account for taxes, so it is more like $700k. The other $300k belongs to the government when it is realized.

If that IRA is Roth, then I get every dollar and do not owe income tax on it.

So if I am doing retirement calculations to live on that money at a 4% withdrawal rate and I am trying to budget my after tax dollars, then I would effectively need to live on 30% fewer dollars each year if I am working with a traditional.

The Outthinking Investor is great for hearing about long-term strategies and thinking outside the box when it comes to market moves. I find the in-depth discussions really insightful, especially when they explore unconventional ideas that challenge typical investment strategies.

Unhedged is another one I’ve been hooked on. They do a nice job of breaking down market developments without getting too technical, making it a great listen for more straightforward, honest takes on the stock market and economic news.

I have read through MANY posts on here and several investing articles (most seem to be selling something). I am also still relatively new at investing outside of my 401K and Roth IRA. That is why I thought I would go ahead and post this question to get your opinions on this.

Here is a quick history... I was planning to pay our house off early, but with a 2.875% mortgage and interest rates going up I decided to put the extra in a HYSA. For the last couple of years it has been over 5% and just recently dropped below, with the latest Fed cut. Including the emergency fund, I now have about $150K in the HYSA. I also have a son graduating in May (and two daughters following in the 3 years following) and will likely need to pull from this to help with college expenses over the next decade.

My question is this, is there a better place to put this money now that HYSA rates are dropping? I expect they will continue to drop given the Fed's current direction. I have considered Dividend ETF's, MMF's, REIT ETF's, etc. I am a little nervous putting needed cash in a market ETF give the stellar run the markets have had over the last two years.

Each month the money was a different amount so I can't just use a linear increase by say x%. Compounding could be yearly or monthly but the deposits would be monthly.

Is there a good online calculator for this or can someone help me with a formula that will show me the cumulative gain of these varying deposits to make a running totals column?

In 2020, in one of the statements, 95%, the part corresponding to annuities was just gone, it was just substracted (""change. in value""). Ever since that, they don't even include insurance/annuities as an asset type in the statement, even though they do have other ones, such as mutual funds, even if they are in zeros.

personalfinance,Single Stock Portfolio Diversification,"Hi,

  
I am a US/UK 23 year old dual citizen living in the UK. This makes investing a complex hell due to the US taxing citizens worldwide.

Due to not wanting to encounter US PFIC tax, I cannot invest in ANY fund outside of the US, and I cannot invest in ANY fund/ETF in the US as from a European brokerage account it would require the fund to produce Key Information Documents (KIDs) which US funds do not. So, I cannot invest in ANY fund.

I CAN however invest in single UK and US stocks.

I have recently had some great advice (on this subreddit) that I should invest into Berkshire Hathaway, as they are a single stock which essentially act as an index fund, and they also don't pay dividends which means tax wise it would be a lot simpler as I don't plan to sell for a long time (seems genuinely perfect).

However, I have also been advised that I should not hold 100% of my investments in a single company, which makes sense. My issue now is, I have no idea how to diversify this selection. I am a very new investor who just wanted to invest into the total world stock ETF but I am not able to. My ambition was to have a very simple lowish risk portfolio which I thought the total world stock ETF would be perfect for.

I am looking for advice on how I could diversify my investments, which other companies would be good to invest into like Berkshire Hathaway. How many other companies would be an ideal amount?

The family consists of me (27M), my wife (26F), and our son (4 months). I work and make $89K a year and my wife is a stay at home mom. We got married last November. 

I purchase our house ($250k value) two weeks before we got married and put 30% down. I paid off the mortgage a few months back so we now own 100% of the house. I'm the only one on the deed. 

Are there any benefits or drawbacks to adding my wife to the deed? I want to make her life as easy as possible if I were to pass away or become incapacitated. I want her to be taken care of and just focus on our son. 

We have a super healthy relationship... but I'm not naive enough to think divorce can never happen to me. But I know myself and even if i lose 80% of my assets in the divorce ,I would be more upset about losing her.

In total I bought all of the shares for £3,000. Given the increase in the price of the stocks now would be the perfect time for me to sell without getting hit too hard by fx(£2.19).

I don't know if I should just hold as I'm not Interested in short term investing, I'm here for the long ride so I'm not sure if it'll make all the  difference in 10 years. 

Equally it would be great if I can buy at the next drop, and get my average share price down to £100. 

This is only £3,000 which is within my 10% ""Play"" or ""Gamble"" money. It would be a bummer if I made a loss but it's really not the end of the world and at the moment it's not likely to happen

I am going to call TransUnion and make a dispute, but neither the bank nor the lender will provide supporting documentation. What are my chances of getting this removed? I'm about to apply for a home loan this week. Will that ramp my interest rate up?

Story:

I get a letter from my auto loan place a few months ago. My payment is late. ""SHIT I forgot to call them and give them the new account number after the whole bank account debacle!""

I call them and pay and asked them if this would have hit my credit. They say ""no. It did not go to collections and it should not show up on your credit""

Now, months later, I see that I have a hit on my credit for late payment. My credit score drops about 120 points.

I called TransUnion and they said to get a letter from the auto finance place saying I shored it all up, and to explain the issue with the freezing of the bank account.

The bank won't give me any evidence that the account was ever frozen and the auto place won't give me any supporting documentation to help my case.

Should I just file a dispute with the credit agency anyways and hope they accept it? Will they take my word for it that my bank account was frozen? I had like 100k liquidity the whole time and had no issue whatsoever paying it.

My wife and I were fine , not great but fine, as far as finances go. 

Had a kid, and needed to move to a safer area. After moving I needed to switch jobs and lost monthly income but was still scraping by

Rent and utilities spiked - combined increase of  initially 500 per month but after they were raised it is no closer to 800

I could no longer afford my truck and other miscellaneous bills

Tried to sell the truck but was upside down. But had to get rid of the payment so I took out a loan to cover the negative equity and sold it. 

Ended up defaulting on the loan and other various credit cards and bills. 

I am current on my wife’s car payment, my rent and all utilities , and my child’s daycare (which was also an added expense )

Now that a short back story has been established here is the question at hand. 

My grandmother recently passed and my mother has sold the house and moved across the country to live with me (she needs assistance)

She just put a cash offer on a home right next door to me and it was accepted. But this is only temporary eventually that home will be sold and we will be moving into a larger house together. 

Finally the question. 

She’s offering to give me about 50k to pay off all of mine and my wife’s debt, essentially starting from scratch. 

Well, not give me because I would be creating a payment plan with her. She is very relaxed about how much I pay her but even at $500 a month that’s still a little over 8 years to pay back.

But since I have not been paying these bills it really would not help my cash flow at all, of all the bills in default I’m only really paying about 650/700 a month. ( I wrote all this down but don’t remember the numbers ) maybe less

Essentially I’m worried that yes my debt will be cleared but without an increase of cash flow if it’s really a good move. I don’t want to take this money for nothing I want it to be a way to start clean.

Sometimes I am working alone and I have the opportunity to listen to something, instead of music I choose audiobooks.

I would like recommendations on books, but not books where just saving a set amount and investing it and then cashing out at 65 is emphasized . I already invest money in the stock market and that’s my backup retirement plan.

I have big goals, I aspire to run my own electrical contracting business one day and have a diversified real estate portfolio.

Please share books that you think will help me in my journey and improve my financial knowledge and mindset.

Thanks.

personalfinance,Best way to get money to finish school? ," 

Hey everyone! 

So, long story short: 

My sister and I have a Home Owner line of credit (through my parents) - in Canada. It is 400k (we only have 8k left, rate is 7.2%, current interest payments are 2000). My sister will complete her degree in Occupational Therapy in December (attended school in the USA - then she has OPT to work … but doesn’t have a secured job yet) 

I’m in medical school - 4 terms left (14k per term) to pay so 56k to 100k remaining with living expenses. 

I also have provincial student loans worth about $38k per year = 76k 

Does anyone know any options of how I can get more money? I’d only need around 20k. Should I just put it on a credit card when I get to the end? The Line of credit is with BMO if that makes a difference. 

Thank you!

personalfinance,Scarcity mindset and need help figuring out my budget,"DH and I (39 F) grew up with scarcity mindset,always try to save as much as we can, but I think we can lossen up a little now that I am approaching 40. 

1.8m in index funds, 
100k in savings account earning about 4 percent interest
6k monthly in rental income after expenses across a few multi-family homes(not sure of how much they are worth, not important as we don't plan to sell during our lifetime.)
We own our own home, house payment is about  3500 a month for mortgage and property tax. If we rent it out after we move we can get about 5k, but probably not much left after agents fee,repair etc. Home value is not important as we don't plan to sell.

I currently make about 200k a year but this could be reduced any time. DH is at 150k a year, however he may not be able to keep his job next year when we move. I should be able to keep my job but it's not a stable industry. 

Monthly spend with 2 kids is less than 10k a month. One in public school one at daycare. 

I am starting to look at private school, better travels and feel like we can spend more than 10k a month but how much more can we afford if we assume that DH will not keep his job and I will only work for another 2 years?

Or is our scarcity mindset necessarily for us to FIRE in the next couple?

personalfinance,Inherited a third of a house and sold the house - what to do to leverage and what happens with my taxes?,"Hi all! I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and am looking for some help. As the title alludes to, I inherited a third of a house and the house was recently sold. For more context, my dad passed away in 2022 and his sisters decided to sell the house. This house was under a trust set up by my late grandma and I received a third of the profits after they sold the house. 

This is a sizable amount (\~200k) of money and I don't know what to do with it aside from stick it in a HYSA. I max out my 401k at work and will not qualify for Roth IRA contributions this year due to some realized market gains for 2024. I will note that I do not own a home - I would be a first time buyer, which I believe would give me some sort of tax break on possible taxes (but more on taxes below since I'm really out of my depths here). I live in an extremely high COL area and cannot afford a 30+ year mortgage at $6-8k month minimum. I have no experience with real estate. Would it make sense for me to explore the possibility of investing in a property in a lower cost state? 

More generally, what's the wisest thing for me to do with this money? I'll also note that I am nowhere close to retirement age (\~30 years out). I do not have a high risk tolerance but I also don't want to stick this money under the bed, so to speak, and not explore possibilities to let this money grow for my future.

On taxes: My understanding is that the trust owes taxes. After the trust pays the taxes, my understanding is that I may have to pay some personal income taxes and/or capital gain taxes too...is this true? The house was sold in Hawaii and I am a California resident. Should I get a CPA and if so, in which state? Or will it be intuitive enough for me to figure out on Turbotax on how to treat this situation?

  
I appreciate any help you can provide. Thank you.

I started a new job in March and attempted to rollover my funds from my old 401k (let’s call it fund A) to my new 401k (let’s call it fund B) at the beginning of July. They are managed by different companies. 

In mid-August I received a notification from fund A that my distribution check was returned and that I needed to re-request a distribution. In late August (27/28) I re-requested the distribution. I contacted fund B at the end of September and they still had not received a check. 

This week I called fund A and they sent out a stop and re-issue. They then emailed me and said that my old company had switched providers for retirement fund managing in September (let’s call it fund C). I called fund C this week and they said that my name and funds were not transferred over when my old company made the switch. I also checked and the blackout period to move funds from fund A was September 1-13, so my redistribution missed that deadline. Fund A is now telling me they can no longer see my account and where the check went because of this switch. 

I’ve been back and forth with fund A on where my money is. They seem to keep pointing the finger at Funds b and c to figure it out. I had a call with the account and funds tracker and he said he’s “never seen something like this before. I also learned today that Charles Schwab is involved in both fund A and C and they have not reached back out to me or my contacts about where my funds are yet - hoping they know.

We currently own and have a mortgage of 310k left at 2.65%, our home is worth 619k according to an appraisal we just had completed when we began looking at options. It’s so hot here I’m not sure the values would continue to rise or if we have reached our peak. 

We realize we will be moving to an area that is much more expensive and will probably be paying 800k+ for a house that fits our needs. 

The dilemma comes from selling or renting, our mortgage broker says based off our incomes (110k+ commission and 99k) we could keep the home as a rental and get another mortgage for the new home after using a heloc/he loan for a down payment. We haven’t seriously looked into this option so this is from a 20 minute conversation with him. 

Renting in our area would get us around 3500 and our mortgage is 2200 so it would allow us to also have a property manager take care of the oversight. 

Our debts are large but only school loans combined at 75k sitting at 9% (I know the interest sucks) and we have an emergency fund with 3 months expenses as well as retirement etc. Current monthly expenses are manageable with one of us losing our jobs, but the second mortgage would definitely cause strain if we lost a job and didn’t have a renter.

personalfinance,Need help choosing PPO vs HDHP ,"**Hi all! Want to thank you in advance. We had open enrollment meetings today and I am STRESSED.**

I am 28 y/o, take a few prescriptions, get allergy shots (which i may end regardless but would be a big problem if i went with HDHP), but besides that i don’t go to the doctor too often. Not planning on having kids anytime soon either. Been dealing with a medical issue recently that will require an upper endoscopy in the next 6 months though that I’ve been avoiding bc of my current deductible (6k PPO). I’m estimating that alone is going to cost around $2.5k after insurance as it is diagnostic (debating holding off until Jan to do this, but I’ve been putting it off so long. Will only delay if I change to a plan where meeting the deductible soon is important, but i've already delayed it so long).

So far in 2024, I’ve only paid $60 into my 6k deductible (crappy PPO), and about $2.7k into my OOP Max. I’m expecting a similar spend next year, unless I do my endoscopy in January. Of course can't predict the future, but no planned surgeries.

I'm leaning towards HDHP 2 or spending the most for the PPO, but really lost on what makes the most sense.

My employer is offering 4 different options for insurance. I am currently on a PPO with a high deductible. Both HDHP plans they will be contributing $50 a month to.

Mental health $75 copay 

RX - $10/$35/$75/$250

personalfinance,Having SERIOUS issues rolling over my 401k to a Traditional IRA (I might be screwed),"**SOLVED THIS HAS BEEN SOLVED VANGUARD GAVE ME INCORRECT INFO**

the events: 


**Event 1:** I called my 401k provider. They directed my through the website on how to request a rollover and told me where to input the field for the financial institution, the mailing address, and the Account # to receive the rollover. After the call I filled in these fields. I found that I could not proceed without filling out all required fields, which included my banking information. I figured this was just in case there was an issue sending the money to vanguard.

**Event 2:** I found that my entire 401k was deposited into my bank account. 


**Event 3:** I called Vanguard and asked if I could do an indirect rollover since the money wasn't sent to them. They said they could not. They suggested I called my bank and ask for the deposit to be reversed back to the 401k.


**Event 4:** I called my 401k company and they said that I should have contacted Vanguard and filled out a form with them, which didn't line up with my previous conversation with them in event 1. They suggested I call my bank to reverse it back to them and then we could try again.


**Event 5:** I called my bank and they say the deposit was posted and cannot be reversed.

Are there other institutions that can support an indirect rollover of funds received within the 60 day requirement? Should Vanguard be able to do this? Could I maybe just send the money back to the 401k manually with some sort of wire transaction? Am I cooked?",1728509438.0,0,7,1g02qbi

personalfinance,In Defense of 401(k) Loans: A First-Time Homebuyer's Experience,"Conventional wisdom is to never touch one's 401(k) or 403(b) account before retirement unless absolutely necessary. The mere suggestion puts PF redditors' hair on end, conjuring [horror stories](/r/personalfinance/comments/1fy4v0p/),
recollections of financial emergencies, and images of Dave Ramsey pulling out his remaining hair.
""It is crazy.  Loans against your 401k should be taken in the event of an emergency only,""
[they say](/r/personalfinance/comments/1ailty1/i).

Despite the stigma around it, taking a 401(k) loan for a primary residence purchase can be a powerful implement in your financial planning toolbox. Today, we will look at a scenario where it does make sense.


### Assumptions

RC is a Recent College graduate and a young professional. 
He has a stable job with a 401(k), an HSA, a Roth IRA, a rented apartment, low debt, and an emergency fund.
He is unmarried.
RC's goal is to own a home in the next 2-5 years while contributing as much as he can to retirement.

Most professional careers have their greatest salary growth within the first 5 years of employment.
This is when workers graduate from entry-level positions to more senior roles. 
Anecdotally, my own salary more than doubled by the end of my 5th year. That may have been extremely lucky, 
but cross-referencing years of experience with salary grades shows that even the ""average"" professional career path 
will experience a large pay bump after a few years.

Therefore, we shall assume that RC cannot afford to maximize his Retirement Contributions while saving at a rate that would allow him to purchase a home in his target time frame, until later in his career.

Enter the 401(k) loan.

### The Strategy

RC's situation is not uncommon. In 2024, the contribution limits for a single filer under 50
are $23,000 for 401(k) + $7,000 IRA + $4,150 HSA = $34,150. Even if the 401(k) is all Traditional contributions,
that's still a difficult number to hit on an entry-level salary. If he wants to substantially increase his home purchasing savings, he'll have to reduce retirement contributions and permanently miss out on the tax benefits.

This is exactly where planning to take a 401(k) loan makes sense. 
By using the 401(k) as a savings vessel for the down payment and closing costs, 
RC can effectively ""get ahead"" or ""not fall behind"" on retirement contributions, depending on one's perspective.
After several years, once he has saved up several tens of thousands of dollars towards purchasing costs, he will then take a 401(k) loan. In the words of Troy Segal at [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/borrow-from-401k-loan.asp), ""A 401(k) loan can provide immediate funds to cover the down payment or closing costs for a home It won't affect your ability to qualify for a mortgage, either. Since the 401(k) loan isn't technically a debt—you're withdrawing your own money, after all—it doesn't impact your debt-to-income ratio or your credit score, two big factors that influence lenders.""

When taken for purchase of a primary residence, a 401(k) loan also does not need to be paid back within the usual 5 year window. It is entirely possible to take a long-term loan and pay it back early when the money comes in--effectively ""retroactively"" contributing to your 401(k).
Under these assumptions, there is no opportunity cost of missed growth by taking the loan: because it is money that wouldn't have been invested anyway.

According to our assumptions, RC will be due for a big salary increase within a few years of starting work. For me, this happened right at the 2-year mark. For my coworker, it happens at 6 months. Sometime after the raise is in the bag, RC will start house hunting.

### My Experience

Using a 401(k) for house savings with the intention of taking a loan worked out very well for me. Here are the hard numbers.

 * Year 1: Graduated in summer and started new job in fall. Gross income: $56k. Roth 401(k): $19k. Employer match (Trad): $5.8k
 * Year 2: Gross income: $75k. Roth 401(k): $13.5k. Trad 401(k): $6k. Employer match: $6k.
 * Year 3: Changed jobs mid-year. Gross income: $99k. Roth 401(k): $13.5k. Trad 401(k): $6k. Employer match: $6.5k.
 * Year 4: Began house hunting. Gross income: $120k. Roth 401(k): $3.5k. Trad 401(k): $20k. Employer match: $10.8k.
 * Year 5: Took a $20k 401(k) loan and $20k savings and bought home early in the year. Loan was approx. $1k/month over 20 months. Then: Gross income: $135k. Roth 401(k): $1.5k. Trad 401(k): $21k. 
 * Year 6: Repaid loan early. Gross income: $150k. Trad 401(k): $23k. 

A Roth IRA and an HSA were maxed each year as well.

As you can see, in Years 1-2, I would not have been able to save aggressively for a house while making the maximum contributions. And although I've been unusually blessed by income in job#2, the general savings would work for a wide range of middle-class incomes with a modified timeline.


### Important Considerations

The downsides and risks of a 401(k) loan are discussed thoroughly elsewhere in this subreddit and online. I won't repeat them here, but in the context of this strategy, there are some important additional things to consider:

 - This only applies to a home buyer who doesn't make enough to **both** max out the 401(k) **and** meet home purchase savings goals, for at least one year. If you make enough to do both from Year 1, there's no point.
 - This only applies to a home buyer who will make enough to max out retirement savings, pay the mortgage, **and** pay back the loan in the future. If you won't make enough to do this in the near future, there's no point.
 - If you already own a home or extensive assets that can cover the costs, there is no point.
 - This strategy assumes a stable job once the loan is taken at the higher rate. This is true of any 401(k) loan. If you took a risky job for better pay or want to go job hopping, this is not for you.
 - The loan is taken across the assets in your 401(k) account. Although your plan will allow you to choose among high-risk and low-risk investments from contributions, you cannot choose to only take the loan from the low-risk investments if the market has performed poorly.
 - You pay back the ""interest"" to yourself in after-tax dollars. You may or may not be able to convert them to Roth (related to the ""mega backdoor Roth""). Check the details of your 401(k) plan for how this works, consider potential tax implications, and make sure this is consistent with your savings goals.
 - The exact terms and conditions are highly dependent on your specific plan!
 
 

This plan is not for everyone. If the assumptions don't hold true, or if the risk is unacceptable, don't mess with it. Nevertheless, you should be aware of it--especially it helps you to meet your employer retirement contribution match.",1728507762.0,1,5,1g02358
personalfinance,Help with Credit card debt,"Hi all,

I have been reading a bit, but still find it all a bit confusing. I currently have about 31k in credit card debt (between my wife and I). We went through a rough period where I got laid off work, and caused us to rack up on debt. Eventually my wife found work and were able to stay on the line. 

As of recently I have been fortunate enough to find work in my field, making 92k a year paid weekly. I also work some side jobs to make extra income. Approximately 1600 extra a month. Ideally my wife will also get a new job soon, because we had to move for my new role.

My biggest issue is high interest rates on our credit cards, it’s making it progressively more difficult to pay off, and a bit stressful. I am trying to figure out what would be the smartest thing to do, to figure out a plan to pay it all off, but also avoid having to pay obnoxiously high interest rates.

Than you all in advance, and appreciate any advice that can be given!

personalfinance,Are we overthinking a new mortgage payment?,"My husband and I currently have a $1,660 monthly mortgage payment, including taxes & insurance. We bought in 2020 with a 3% interest rate.

We are considering building a new home that would total around $500,000 and after selling our home and using that money towards a downpayment, our estimated mortgage would be between $2,800-$3,000/month including taxes & insurance. 

Looking at our budget, it seems doable and would allow us to still save $500-600/month without restricting spending in other budget categories.

investing,Starting an HSA in your 40s...,"Very late to the game in terms of investing, but in particular, just got hired for a new job, where my employer offers an HSA with a $1000 contribution, per year. 

I am 43, and I am in good health. Typically, I just go for a PPO / POS low deductible health plan, because I have one kid, and my insurance supports my entire family (Me, my wife, and our son). But we do not typically spend a ton of money on healthcare. 

Granted, that may change, but I live in a MCOL area, make around 200k, and feel I could pay out of pocket for anything that comes up, at least for now. Question is this:

* At this age, am I better off sticking with my current PPO/POS plan, or should I opt for a HDHP and participate in this HSA? 
* For context:
   * A PPO/POS plan would be about 400 bucks (out of my paycheck) per pay period for me and my family, with a $650 deductible for myself, and a $1000 for the family. With a MAX OUT of $2000.
   * The HDHP would be about $250 per pay period, and a $3500 deductible / $6k Family, with a MAX OUT of about $8k. 

The HSA investment options are good (OptumBank), and I know there are tremendous investment / tax-savings benefits here. I'll have a 401(k) with this new employer, and my previous 401k (now IRA) and Brokerage accounts total around 300k.

investing,Why I Think There’s an 85% Chance the Market Goes Up Tomorrow After CPI Data,"With the CPI data set to be released tomorrow, I'm feeling optimistic about the market's potential to close in the green. Here’s why I believe there's an 85% chance the market will rise following the CPI announcement:

Projected Inflation Rates: Analysts are forecasting a year-over-year CPI increase of around 2.3%, which would be a significant drop from previous months

If this prediction holds true, it signals easing inflationary pressures, which typically boosts investor confidence.  
Market Sentiment: Historical trends suggest that when CPI data comes in lower than expected, markets, particularly the Nasdaq, often react positively. A lower inflation rate might lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve will take a less aggressive approach to interest rate hikes.

This sentiment could drive up stock prices as investors shift their focus back to growth opportunities.  
External Factors: Recent trends show declining energy prices, which have contributed to lowering overall inflation​.

If these trends continue and align with the CPI data, it could further reinforce a bullish outlook among traders.  
Earnings and Economic Indicators: Positive reports from the labor market and other economic indicators support the idea that the economy is on solid footing.

If the CPI data confirms this narrative, we could see a substantial market rally.  
Of course, nothing is guaranteed in the markets, but the combination of favorable CPI projections, historical market responses, and supportive economic conditions gives me a strong sense of optimism.

investing,Lump Sum or Dollar Cost Average for funds,"Genuine question here from someone who’s just started investing. I know dollar cost averaging is generally the safer method of getting into a new position, but I was wondering if this applies to index funds and etfs. If the goal is to invest for gains longterm, wouldn’t averaging a share price in a given year be insignificant 20 years down the line if the fund is expected to grow its returns? I’ve been thinking that if the overall year returns are usually positive, wouldn’t it make sense to buy into a position early to benefit from the additional gains throughout that year as opposed to splitting the investment into several months/weeks and losing out on time in the market. I’d appreciate any thoughts on this

investing,Forex Macro Strategy Advice,"

So here’s my attempt at using macro indicators and applying a statistical approach to generate a bias on a currency pair. 
I’ve been backtesting it but so far I haven’t achieved the results I want. I’m hoping someone here has more experience can help me get on the right path or just outright tell me my idea isn’t going to work. 

The principle is to score economic indicators and their impact on GDP, so when a new indicator is published my algorithm will calculate the score for that indicator and all the previous indicators released in the last 30 days and then calculate an average score for that country. In theory if I do the same for the other currency in the pair I can determine which one is stronger/weaker and then use TA to make an entry. 

 The following section will outline how I calculate the score. Each score is made up of , the relationship of the indicator to GDP

I’ll explain with an example. 
Let’s consider unemployment over the course of 2010-2015 these are the the steps I followed: 

## Preparing the Data
My data is in a dataframe (think of it like excel but in python) with three columns. The first. Column contains the date when the indicator is published the second column contains the unemployment value and the third the GDP value. Since GDP comes out quarterly and unemployment monthly I have computed intermediate GDP values linearly. The result is that the unemployment and GDP columns have the same number of entries. 

## Calculating lag between unemployment and GDP
To calculate the lag between unemployment and its effect on GDP, I used the Granger Casuality test as a starting point but this number can be tweaked later. Let’s say unemployment lags GDP by 3 months, so the effects of an increase in unemployment will show on the economy 3 months later. 
Finally, since unemployment lags GDP by 3 months I need to align the unemployment timeseries with the GDP timeseries by shifting GDP forward by 3 months, that way the unemployment level and its corresponding GDP levels are aligned. 

## Associating unemployment levels with GDP
The next step in the process is to associate unemployment levels with GDP. To do this I split up the unemployment timeseries into bins of let’s say 0.5%. This would look something like:
0%-0.5% , 0.5%-1% …. 2% - 2.5%, 3%-3.5% etc. 
Now for each bin I calculate the average GDP across my data. So for example to calculate the average GDP between 2-%-2.5% I go through my (shifted) and compute the average GDP of every row which has unemployment within that range. I do this across all the bins and the result is a new data frame with bin ranges in one column and the average GDP value for that range across the whole dataset in the second column. 

Now that unemployment levels are associated with their respective average GDP I can calculate a score for unemployment. 

## Scoring unemployment
We’re at a point now where we have a dataframe with bins in one column and average GDP for each bin in the other. I now simply create a linear score from -10 to +10 for each unemployment level. So the lowest average GDP value would get a score of -10 and the highest GDP value will get a score of +10. 

So the data frame looks something like:

| Bins   | GDP | Score |
|--------|-----|-------|
| 0-0.5% | 6   | 10    |
| 1-1.5% | 5   | 8     |
| 1.5-2% | 3   | 5     |
| …      | …   | …     |
| 6-6.5% | 2   | -10   |

This is just an example, there’s a lot more data in the actual analysis. 

## Scoring newly published data
Now when a new unemployment value comes out, all I have to do is find which bin it corresponds to and look up the score for that bin. The idea is that if I do this with say 5-10 indicators and average their scores and do the same with another country I can determine which one is stronger/weaker.

My hourly went from $18 plus commission , $22 plus commission, to now $29 plus monthly bonus here in Northern California.

personalfinance,Lump sum $$ gift from relative. Deciding what to do with it..,"Hi. So first time post (anywhere..not just this thread). Looking for some guidance or, I guess confirmation i'm on the right track here. Long story short, I'm a 27 M, who fortunately has a grandfather that did very well in life. Although not around much as a kid, he is in our lives now and feeling generous. Anyways, he recently gave me a gift of $150,000 and i'm looking at all options on where to allocate the funds. 

  
Currently, I have about $10k in cash savings (emergency fund)..I like to keep a couple grand in checking for bill pay, rent, etc. - A Roth and personal brokerage account that I manage myself with about $13k between both accounts. A retirement account that is employer matched that is at about $15k. I also have no consumer debt, only student loans in the ballpark of $15k. I also make about $100k a year, living with my girlfriend (NYC) that makes around the same..things are great and serious, so really looking towards future..

  
My plan is to knockout the student loans first ($15k) and then play around with the cash. A couple key items I have thought about that bring up some questions. 

* I think I want to take approx $85k and put it in a new brokerage, with someone else managing it. Although I do pretty well with the small amount I allocate to my roth and brokerage each month, I feel like this is where I can take the next step, find someone who I can build a relationship with and potentially look to kids college accounts. The career path I am on is open to income and investing opportunities, increasing exponentially. 
   * I guess my question is, what/who is the best thing to look for in this case.
   * Are their minimums/people who wont even take on $85k (meaning too low?) 
* Going to max out my Roth IRA contributions for this year (about $5k).. I just feel like that is right to do..
* However, I am not going to attribute anything to my employment matching account.
   * I should probably look at my account information, but I might miss out on employment matching if I don't contribute through my paychecks for the rest of the contribution year?
* I do want to put some cash into my personal brokerage account. Around $18.5k. I can still invest how I want, be able to liquidate shares whenever, play around, etc. Nothing risky, but I enjoy doing researching on my own and finding places to put money. 
* I then will put about $25k into my savings. I currently have a basic savings account, with the same bank that i have checking with. With this allocation, I want to start looking at some HYSA, maybe an online bank, to max out as much APY as I can get. 
   * Is the HYSA worth it? Am I better off reallocating this money elsewhere in the plan? And what recommendations would you have on where to look for best %
* The last little chunk of cash, think that brings me to $1.5k i'd keep for checking or whatever. 

  
Here for any ideas, or re-direction on my thinking. I wouldn't say i'm financially illiterate..probably know more than i think.. just a nice chunk of change coming at you out of nowhere can make you second guess yourself a bit. Also, something makes me think in the back of my mind this is also a test, to see if my grandfather will keep it coming as he gets older and older...

In my eyes, it’s got everything I need and everything I’d want in a vehicle (all the safety features, fun to drive, practical, semi-luxurious and most importantly reliable). It’s truly a car I’d keep forever. In my area, however, they go for ~$27-30K with average mileage. This would mean that I’d likely need to finance - is this something I should go for? 
My parents also offered to help pay down the principal if I chose to finance the car.

I can always buy a beater, but if I’m honest I know I’d get tired of it in a few years and would look to get rid of it. So what do y’all think?

personalfinance,Claiming tax credit for income in both states- please advise,"Hi,  
  
1)) I lived in MD from 01/2023 - 03/2023 and paid taxes to MD ONLY . I then moved to MA from 03/1/2023 - 12/31/2023 but had not updated my W4  so my taxes were still being paid to MD ONLY for the whole year even though I had moved to MA.  
  
I believe I will get a refund for the MD taxes as a part-year resident but I will also owe MA taxes as a part year resident. **3) Can I claim a tax credit in my MA return for having paid to MD in 2023 since I had not been living there although taxes were taken by MD only?**  
  
Online it says you can claim credit if the income was taxed by both states so does ""taxed by both states"" mean the taxes would have had to be taken from MD and MA together **IN 2023 (e.g. W4 should have both states listed)** to qualify for this credit? Or does it mean that since my taxes were paid to MD in 2023 and now in 2024, I will be ""charging"" that income to MA taxes that I can still request that credit?  
  
2)On the FreeTaxUSA, it asks ""Would you let me know the difference between ""**Enter the total tax you paid** to \[Maryland\] on this income"" versus ""**Enter the tax withheld as shown on** your \[Maryland\] return""?

I inherited an apartment and i also have a home on a loan (1k loan and around 60-400€ on utilities monthly)
 
Me and my partner make around 3500-4000€ total a month and we keep around 2000-2500 bills (Both work full time job and part time job)

We also have a 5yo child, a cat and a dog

Currently i drive 100km daily to work. The apartment would save me from driving that much daily, since the place is very close to my workplace and is located in capital city.

The apartment wouldn’t really generate a lot in rent money, max 300-400€ a month, max. And selling our current place would free us from part time job and a home loan, would free up extra money for investing aswell.

im alrdy covered by my parents health insurance plan until im 25 y/o, so im wondering if it makes sense to contribute to an HSA account now (id still use my parents healthcare plan bc it’s better coverage) & be double covered, OR if i should just start contributing once i turn 26 since the $190 biweekly premiums health insurance isnt something i NEED to be paying right now & i could be using this $ for something else

for reference, i did have this hsa account at my last company bc the biweekly premiums were $0 & they contributed $750 for the year, so there was no “net negative” to have this account open. that would not be the case necessarily with my new company, but i also acknowledge that the hsa is triple tax advantaged so it could potentially still have a net positive outcome long term…?

I'm considering paying the collections debt and doing a balance transfer from my other card to consolidate everything on the one card. This card does have interest; however, it would avoid any collections going on my payment history and it would bring my credit utilization from 100% down to about 75%, with one of the cards having 0% utilization. I would then focus on aggressively paying down the card. I currently have both cards locked away and would not be using them for any additional spending. My main concern is that I am trying to move into an apartment soon and want to avoid the collections making a negative impact on my credit standing, and increase my score a little if possible. If that is my concern, would it be wise to put it all on the one card, or would it be better to pay everything off separate?

Don’t panic! I have paid off the remaining credit cards and have NOT racked them up again. I have learned from my mistake of what felt like I was drowning in crippling debt and have paid off the cards every month with no interest accruing! 
I have learned to balance wants vs needs and have paid down 8k of debt in the past 6 months.

My interest rate is 19% on the current loan and monthly payment is $305.

personalfinance,What is the best way to find good loan rates?,"My truck died and the amount it needed I deemed more than I wanted to pay. I’ve been wanting something else anyway. 

However, I didn’t get much from a broken truck and I sold the truck knowing I would need to finance a small amount to get something else. 

I do not want a car loan, with how little I want to borrow the insurance would cost considerably more than even a high interest rate. 

I want to borrow around 5 or 6k as a personal loan. I have nothing to borrow against but I have a, roughly, 820 credit score. 

Interest rates are ridiculous. I knew that but what is the best way to find low interest rates? Just start calling banks and credit unions? 

I can get an 11.25 percent rate currently with my normal credit union. I get the idea I won’t get much better, but that’s pretty high to me.

personalfinance,Need held regarding my Education Loan ,"Hi all,

I need advice on a serious issue with my education loan from SBI.

In 2020, I took a loan (below 7.5 lakhs, no collateral) for my CSE degree at Chitkara University. The sanction letter clearly stated a 60-month moratorium period, meaning the EMIs should start in the second half of 2025, or one year after graduation. However, since February 2024, I’ve been receiving messages from the bank that my EMIs are due. I was shocked as I was still in my internship and nowhere close to being able to repay.

When I approached my home branch, they said it was a technical issue and promised it would be fixed. In the meantime, they transferred around ₹44,000 of the subsidy to my account, (it was supposed to be there) which was automatically used for EMIs for six months. Now, with that exhausted, I’m getting daily calls from the bank saying my EMIs are overdue.
The subsidy was used to cover the EMIs for six months without resolving the issue.

Despite multiple visits to my home branch and filing online complaints, nothing has been resolved. The branch just forwards the issue to another department without any real action. They suggested I start paying to avoid damage to my CIBIL score, but I can’t afford it right now as I’ve just started my career.

This situation is causing me significant mental stress and affecting my ability to focus on work. If this is not fixed soon, I believe the bank should be held responsible for any damage to my CIBIL score or financial standing.

I’m seeking advice on how to escalate this, possibly to the RBI or through legal means. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",1728554986.0,2,3,1g0fezq
personalfinance,"At what stage in life do I do more than Index the SP500, is it time for an advisor?","I'm 57 years old and for the last 40 years my sole investment strategy was all in on an SP500 index fund and it's been very very good to me.   I rarely look at my investments but I'm sure if I looked at it monthly over the years there would have been times I would have been thrilled and others I would have panicked but over the long haul it's just been good.

Recently my MIL passed away and my FIL is getting near end of life so my wife has taken over their finances.   We've met with their financial advisor several times and I really like him.  Although we've briefly talked about my finances he's never tried to sell me anything.

I enjoy working, I enjoy my job and I'll probably work another 10 years.   Financially we are sound.   We have zero debt, 7 figure retirement account, 5 figure emergency fund in an HYSA.

If we have a broken pipe we call a plumber, could I watch a dozen YouTube videos and figure out how to fix things, maybe but I don't have the time nor desire.   I can look at my major expenses over the last few years and think if I would have just learned to fix a diesel motor, if I would have just learned to build a deck, if I would have just learned to do a root canal on my wife then I'd be rich!   For some investing is a hobby and for some it's a necessity.   I have far too many hobbies already and I'm thinking at some point it's time to turn my investing over to someone who does this for a living and enjoys this.   Will it cost me something, of course, but is it better than being in the SP500 at 67 and it happens to be at a ten year low so I feel like I need to work until 80 and hope it turns around, I think so.

Is there a point at which working with an advisor makes sense?   Is there a point at which the simple advice, which has been good to me, of ""just index it"" isn't the best advice?  If so what's that timing, at what stage in life?",1728553311.0,1,22,1g0f15n

He decided to give it a try & created an account thinking that he could just go & add $200 cash to his Chime account at Walgreens & that he'd receive the bonus, but apparently that isn't considered a direct deposit & that kinda poses a problem considering he doesn't exactly have an employer to set up direct deposit with. He works for himself doing various odd jobs & piece work for cash &/or an occasional check. How can we figure out a way for him to direct deposit the $200 to himself one time?

personalfinance,"After 13 Moves in 8 Years, We’re Finally Ready to Buy – But Facing a Mortgage Roadblock","I hope this is the right subreddit to ask for advice. We’re looking for some help and hoping to find useful tips. Thanks in advance for your time!

Here’s our situation: My wife and I live in Hungary. I’m Dutch, and my wife is Hungarian. We moved to Hungary when she became homesick after getting pregnant. For the past 5 years, we’ve rented several houses, but we’ve finally decided we want to buy. We’ve been renting our current home for almost two years, and we’ve fallen in love with it. We’re considering purchasing it for 130,000,000 HUF ($355,000).

The house is perfect for us—a two-story home with 4 bedrooms, which is ideal since we both work from home and have two children. The layout is just right: one bedroom for us, one for each child, and one to use as an office. It’s located in a forest. It’s quiet and safe, as it’s part of a gated area with only two other houses nearby. The house itself is about 130 sqm. And the plot it’s on is about 3800 sqm.

Having moved a combined total of 13 times in the past 8 years, we’re exhausted from moving, especially now with two small kids. In fact, our second child was born in this very house! We really don’t want to go through the process of moving again, and we feel that this is the perfect home for us.

Here’s the challenge: we could technically buy the house, but we’re held back by a few financial factors. First off, we don’t have enough cash on hand. The house costs 130,000,000 HUF ($355,000), but we’re short about $42,500. The bank has approved us for the maximum mortgage available, which is 100,000,000 HUF ($273,000). We can cover the 10% down payment of 13,000,000 HUF ($35,500) from our savings. However, the remaining 17,000,000 HUF ($42,500) is the problem. We initially thought we could borrow this amount from a friend (as an actual loan with interest), but the bank doesn’t allow that.

Both my wife and I are entrepreneurs, working for a company based in the Netherlands. We worked for the same company when we lived in the Netherlands. We love the company so much we wanted to keep working there. Loyalty is very important to us. My wife was on maternity leave for almost all of 2023, which lowered her income by about 50%, so the bank is mostly basing the mortgage on my income. Unfortunately, securing a loan above 100,000,000 HUF is extremely difficult, especially because I’m a foreigner (there’s additional paperwork, official translations, etc.). Our financial advisor, who works on commission, strongly advised against pursuing this route further. Waiting for march 2025 would be ideal (when the tax papers come available). But the current landlord doesn’t want to wait this long. They could’ve started selling in January 2024, but waited until June 2024 for us. They’re amazing people. But I get that they also cannot risk waiting and waiting for only us. 

It’s incredibly frustrating to be short “only” $42,500, especially since we are fully capable of paying it back as a loan alongside the mortgage. But the bank won’t allow it, and, to be fair, we also should have saved more. We were even advised to take the loan out in my mother-in-law’s name, with her withdrawing the cash for us. But we quickly realized this would essentially be money laundering, and we absolutely don’t want to do anything illegal. We want to live peacefully, without stress or legal risks.

We have looked into other houses also. But the layout, location and building style makes this truly perfect for our situation. If it’s not possibly to buy, we will move to a different place of course. But we’re hoping to see if there’s any option we haven’t thought of yet. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! This is truly our dream home—located in a unique area, built to high standards with excellent energy efficiency, and the first place where we’ve truly felt at home in years. Thanks a lot for your time. ",1728549924.0,4,3,1g0ebfy
personalfinance,"In position of saving 2000$/month for the next 2-3 years, need advice","Hello everyone,

First of all, the wiki is amazing. This community makes so many of this overwhelming mass of information so digestible. Thank you for that.

Here is my case:

Grew up poor in France, got my education right (thanks mom), no debt, and moving from China to the US on a J-1 Visa as a Post-Doctoral researcher. My history makes it so I do not need to pay taxes on income for the next 3 years, with no retroactive clause (China/USA tax treaty exempts researchers who are China residents prior to moving to the US)  if I end up staying longer.

After factoring out rent, food, utilities, hangouts et stuffs like this, I realized I can save around 2000$/month. My current savings will be partially burnt in the move (plane tickets, deposits, agent fees, yada yada, you got it).

I have no debt, no subscription to streaming services (and do not intend to get one), I make my own coffee, and I do not eat avocado toast more than once every 4 years. My hobbies are hiking, playing guitar, talking about politics endlessly at the table because I am an annoyingly French, and learning languages; nothing extremly expensive.

My plan is as follow:

1. Save around 15 000$, on top of my current savings, as an emergency fund that can cover a move to a big city, if things goes as they are supposed to in the next few years (considering 25000 USD /m of rent + 1000$ for all other expenses). This should be accomplished during the first year, as I am a very frugal person.
2. My institution does not provide any matching compensation for post-docs. They provide a 457(b).

Should I use this plan (allowing 7500$ of contribution per year) or an independent Roth IRA,, knowing I will need to retrive the money from the 457(b) upon leaving the institution ? or should I combine an independent roth IRA + HSA during the second year ?

No windfalls coming my way anytime soon, if ever.

Does this plan sound reasonnable as my starting point ?

The developers have extended our building and are selling those units as condos. There are providing the tenants an opportunity to lock in a unit at a discounted price thru a 2500$ fully refundable, non-binding deposit. Construction is expected to be completed in 12-18 months. 

A one bedroom condo is $625k, which seems to be At least 15% cheaper than other comps in the area for new luxury buildings.

My plan is to put a deposit down, and expect the appraisal to come at much higher than the purchase price. Should I try selling it for a profit or do a HELOC? What is the best strategy?",1728534813.0,3,5,1g0axt4

personalfinance,Trad 401K / Roth IRA / HSA,"Starting a new job shortly and budgeting my retirement accounts out. In a deeper forum, I saw someone advocating to only contribute up to your employer’s match in your 401K, then work on maxing your personal Roth IRA, then HSA, and only then going back to your traditional 401K to fill that up.

I’m 24 y/o, salary is $75000, if I matched my employer’s 6%, maxed out my Roth and my HSA, I’d have $15,650 of contributions for the year. In addition to saving $1000/Mo for my emergency fund, saving and investing now takes up about 37% of my total income, which I feel like may be pushing it a bit.

Any advice or opinions on the order in which I contribute (account wise)? Maybe maxing the HSA can wait? For reference, I have no other debt whatsoever, but I am considering a car loan as I currently drive a 97 Toyota.",1728533208.0,0,4,1g0ailb
personalfinance,Concerning finances after death ,"I'm not planning on going anywhere anytime soon, but I have some questions about this morbid topic, and I'm not really sure who to ask about them, so everyone's old pal Reddit seemed like a good place to start. 

If you have a 401k, and a Roth, and pass away - what happens to that money? That is, when it's passed to your benefactor, how does it work? Do they need to keep it as is in a retirement account until they reach the appropriate age? Is there a penalty or tax when it transfers? 

Also, concerning life insurance - Let's say you have a small $100k policy - if you have a policy that is paid out to your benefactor, is that money taxable? Will they get the full 100k   and have to pay later or is it taxed up front? What would it end up looking like after any potential taxes?

Lastly, What about stocks/bonds/funds? Do they transfer as is without any tax until gains are realized? 

It's probably worth noting that I am asking about the rules within the US - NJ specifically.

So I’m a 18 year old who’s wondered what the future holds in 10 years. I didn’t wanna be those guys who don’t have money later on or struggle to get it, that’s why I’m opening a fidelity account to invest and hold onto stocks as an investment and as long as possible, probably 10 years if possible.

The thing I I’ve asked some people on advice and I’ve mainly being shit on and told I’m wasting my time and money and that I’m too serious for my age. The reason why I wanna invest and the specific stock I wanna hold onto are Amazon and nvidia mainly because those two are good stocks to hold as an investment.


To the experienced investors and those who hold knowledge in that sector, am I right for doing this, and could it be correct that Amazon stock could potentially go up in the future depending on how they do.

I wanna secure a good future where I can have enough money or more to afford a house so I don’t gotta worry,  best to start now.

I'm currently thinking about where I can get the best information - I'm not a trader but rather invest with a medium to long-term horizon. That's why I'm not overly interested in chart theory. I'm also doing all this in my spare time alongside my normal job. 

I'm looking for a YouTube channel, newsletter, online magazine, podcast or any other channel that classifies the market objectively and also likes to take a closer look at and analyze individual companies/stocks. Personally, I'm not so keen on flashy content and people with strong opinions trying to sell you something.

investing,Blue Chip Stock Portfolio Balance,"Hi, I am a new investor wanting to have a **simple** portfolio with similar risk and returns to the Total World Stock ETF. The issue is, I cannot invest in any funds due to my nationality and tax situation. 

I cannot invest in any fund outside of the US due to PFIC tax, and I cannot invest in any fund in the US as I don't have a US residency and they require Key Information Documents from the UK, which US funds do not provide. So my only option is to create an investment portfolio out of single stocks. I please ask that people do not ask questions regarding funds and ETFs or tell me to invest in them because I **can't**.

I currently have about £40k to invest and I want to invest 20% of my monthly income. Here are my options:

- I could technically invest in US ETFs from the UK by using options trading, but it would require investing in 10k-40k chunks. Therefore, I'm thinking I could invest the majority of my capital into the Total World Stock ETF via options, and then invest 20% monthly wage into Berkshire Hathaway. The issue with this is that I am a new investor and I feel uncomfortable investing all of my savings through options. Furthermore, the dividends that ETFs would pay out make the tax more complicated this way.

- Invest 100% into single stocks. I'm currently favouring this option as it wouldn't require me to invest through options (which I don't really understand), and I could specifically choose stocks which don't pay-out dividends which would significantly simplify my tax returns. This way I'm currently thinking of investing in blue chip stocks like Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon, but I don't really know which others. But I would like to diversify a bit more than that. I'm thinking I will hold at least 50% in Berkshire Hathaway though as it seems like the perfect solution to no ETFs.

  
I'm looking for:

- Guidance regarding whether I should invest my lump savings into an ETF via options trading, or whether single blue chip stocks is a better (simpler) way to go.

- Diversification advice on which single stocks (with no dividends) would be a good idea. I'm currently thinking something like 50% Berkshire, 25% Amazon, 25% Markel Group, but I really don't know.",1728546331.0,0,8,1g0dkro
